2011052,"00:00:17.52","00:00:19.49","1","皆さん、も書いたことがあると思うんですけど、"
2011052,"00:00:19.57","00:00:20.50","2","はい、そうですね。"
2011052,"00:00:19.74","00:00:24.82","1","病歴とか、あとまあ、どうーしてここに来たとかーとか、そういったものを書いてもらう、"
2011052,"00:00:25.02","00:00:28.63","1","問診票ー、を書いてもらうというのが、まず仕事だったんですけど、"
2011052,"00:00:28.68","00:00:38.30","1","それをまあ、差し出して、書いていただいてたんですけど、えーまあずーっと、病歴書いていただいて、で、えーっと、下に個人情報を書く欄がありますよね。"
2011052,"00:00:38.31","00:00:42.19","1","お名前とか住所とか、電話番号、まあ会社名とかもいろいろあったんですけど、"
2011052,"00:00:42.43","00:00:46.00","1","でーまあ、最初にその方、なぜか会社名を書き始めたんですよね。"
2011052,"00:00:46.50","00:00:54.65","1","で、会社名書いててー、ん？と思ったのが、ま、その人の名前ー、名前なあと思って、イトウさんー、イトウって書いてんですよ。"
2011052,"00:00:54.86","00:01:05.07","1","で、あれーこの人、会社名なのに何でイトウと書くんだろうと思ってー、「いや、ここ会社名なんですよー」っと言ったら、「いや、これ会社なんですよ」ってその方言うんですよ。"
2011052,"00:01:05.35","00:01:12.88","1","で、あたしは、えー？っと思って、この人、えっ、どう考えてもこの人って、イトウタダシやなあと思ったんですよ。"
2011052,"00:01:13.46","00:01:15.70","1","で、会社名イトウタダシ、おかしい。"
2011052,"00:01:15.70","00:01:26.85","1","でも、この人は会社名って言うから、「ああ、イトウタダシさんてでもー、お名前ですよねー」って言ったら、「いや、私、イトウー、チュウなんです」って言ったんすよ。"
2011052,"00:01:27.25","00:01:30.36","1","と、イトウチュウさん、まあそらそういう人もいるわー、"
2011052,"00:01:30.43","00:01:34.26","1","チュウさんっていう名前もいるかなっと思って、「あっ、また失礼しました」と。"

2011052,"00:01:37.85","00:01:43.81","1","「あの、会社名ではないーと思うんですよ」っと言ったら、「いやいや、会社名なんですよ」って、まあ、言いはるんですよ。"
2011052,"00:01:44.11","00:01:47.38","1","で、うーん、どうしようと思って、"
2011052,"00:01:48.07","00:01:56.69","1","「うーん、でも、ここはお名前なんですよー」っと言っても、やっぱりその人はもう、「それは会社名」っておっしゃるんで、「あ、わかりました」っていう感じで、"
2011052,"00:01:56.79","00:02:05.77","1","で、あたしのなかでー、チュウと言えば、と思って、もうとうとう言ってしまった言葉が、「すいませーん、荒井注さん」って言っちゃったんですよ。"
2011052,"00:02:06.08","00:02:07.86","1","「荒井注さん、すいませーん」"
2011052,"00:02:07.86","00:02:10.53","1","「あのこれー、お名前とお名前ですよねー」って、"

2011052,"00:02:16.23","00:02:20.44","1","「いやいや、あの私荒井注でもない、伊藤忠なんですよ」って言われて、"
2011052,"00:02:20.82","00:02:29.72","1","で、今考えたら、イトウチュウ、伊藤忠商事のことだったんだーと私は思って、その時はもう全然未知だったんでー、もうそれがお名前、だったんですね。"
2011052,"00:02:29.93","00:02:33.69","1","でー、あたしー、自身は、あっ、会社名がほんとに伊藤忠商事だったんだ。"
2011052,"00:02:33.73","00:02:36.03","1","でもそこで、商事まで書いてほしかったんですよ（笑）。"

2011052,"00:02:37.93","00:02:42.87","1","でー、まあ失礼なことをしたなあと思って、その人のことは、あたしもう、最後荒井注さんとかって呼んでしまったんで（笑）、"
2011052,"00:02:44.12","00:02:47.49","1","もっ、もうたいへん申し訳ないことをしたと、思ったんですけども、"

2012027,"00:01:27.92","00:01:31.41","1","で、そこでいっつもだいたい六人ぐらいで、いっつもおんなじようなメンバーで。"
2012027,"00:01:31.95","00:01:37.93","1","毎日おしゃべりしてたんですけど、なんかちょっとどうもその女の人の様子がおかしいんですよね。"

2012027,"00:01:57.50","00:02:01.00","1","で、ま、そいで十分ぐらいたってから、"
2012027,"00:02:01.23","00:02:06.57","1","ま、そのおかしな様子を繰り返して十分ぐらいたったとき、いきなり靴下と靴を脱いで。"
2012027,"00:02:07.34","00:02:09.78","1","そこにあったごみ箱に捨てたんです、いきなり靴を。"

2012027,"00:02:37.22","00:02:42.64","1","そしてまたちょっとしばらくしてから、今度はその着ていたコートを脱いだんですね。"
2012027,"00:02:42.67","00:02:46.23","1","白いなんか、厚手のコートを着てたんですけど、ま、それを脱いで。"

2012027,"00:03:05.94","00:03:09.65","1","で、えってなってて、さすがになんか、これはまずいっていうことになって友達が、"
2012027,"00:03:09.74","00:03:16.19","1","なんかそこから靴とか、その捨てた靴とかコートとかを取って、で、こうなんか着せて。"

2013024,"00:02:13.64","00:02:18.63","1","そこから約一時間、状態が全く変わらなかったんですね。"
2013024,"00:02:18.88","00:02:24.63","1","で、えーとー、私たちも、なんかこう手を握りながら、今か今かっていう状態だったのに"
2013024,"00:02:24.81","00:02:27.94","1","なんか、あれ、なんかまだ、あれ、みたいな。"
2013024,"00:02:27.97","00:02:33.16","1","で、先生たちも、多分、あのそのえーとー、ご自身たちのあのステーションの方で"
2013024,"00:02:33.31","00:02:36.10","1","まーあの脈の状況、見て、見てらっしゃるので"

2013024,"00:02:40.72","00:02:47.22","1","さすがに、二時間ぐらいたったときに、まー夜、夜もだんだん遅くなってきたので、おなかもすいてて、"
2013024,"00:02:47.58","00:02:49.57","1","で、私も弟も主人も。"
2013024,"00:02:49.89","00:02:54.37","1","でまー、ケンタッキーを買ってきてくれてるので、すごい匂いだけがだんだんしてきて"
2013024,"00:02:54.71","00:02:57.19","1","なんか、おなかすいたねっていうふうになって。"
2013024,"00:02:57.55","00:03:04.65","1","ま、母もこの状態変わらないんだったら、どうする、まだ時間もどうか分からないし、食べるってことになって"
2013024,"00:03:04.85","00:03:07.80","1","その個室の中で、結局食べ始めて"
2013024,"00:03:08.12","00:03:15.05","1","んで、ま、あのーま、状況がどう変わるかも分からんで、すごい急いで食べて、で、急いで食べて始末して。"
2013024,"00:03:15.28","00:03:18.73","1","で、だけど、なんかやっぱり、匂いってすごい残るじゃないですか。"
2013024,"00:03:18.83","00:03:21.68","1","だから、ずーっとこう部屋中充満してて。"
2013024,"00:03:21.97","00:03:26.15","1","で、で、あるとき、もうだんだん脈が、ほんとに弱ってきたときに"

2013024,"00:03:39.53","00:03:42.98","1","で、えまー、そこから、もうもうもうほんとに脈がなくなってきたので"
2013024,"00:03:42.98","00:03:47.01","1","結局、人工呼吸器を取り外して、臨終ということになったんですけど。"
2013024,"00:03:47.32","00:03:52.76","1","最後、そのケンタッキーの匂いが充満した部屋で、あの臨終を迎えたという話です。"
2013025,"00:00:00.23","00:00:04.52","1","あのちょっと面白い話ということで考えてたんですけれども、"

2015003,"00:00:28.500","00:00:31.296","1","あのー、「車盗られたのよ。」って言ったんです。"
2015003,"00:00:31.322","00:00:35.671","1","そしたら彼が、「えーちょっと待ってくださいね」って、こう、えー、回しながら、"
2015003,"00:00:35.780","00:00:41.855","1","で、「奥さん昨日は、えー、最後に、車を使ったのはいつですか。」"
2015003,"00:00:42.187","00:00:44.038","1","って賢いことを聞いてくれたんで、"
2015003,"00:00:44.039","00:00:47.244","1","「昨日は忙しかったじゃない、あれしてかれしてかれしてかれして、」"
2015003,"00:00:47.249","00:00:51.667","1","「夜中にね、夜中まで、くあのー、手紙を出さなきゃと思って、」"
2015003,"00:00:51.703","00:00:53.651","1","「ポストまで行ったのよ。」"
2015003,"00:00:53.651","00:00:56.635","1","あ、あそこにおいてきたんだって、気がついたんですよ。それで、"
2015003,"00:00:56.897","00:00:59.995","1","「この件は一回忘れて。」って言って、急いで走って行きました。"
2015003,"00:00:59.996","00:01:01.514","1","車はありました。"
2015003,"00:01:01.913","00:01:06.112","1","ありましたけれども、車のドアがちょっと開けっ放しだったので、私は、"
2015003,"00:01:06.559","00:01:10.340","1","車を止めて、すぐ近くなんですけどポスト。"
2015003,"00:01:10.349","00:01:12.678","1","車をで行って、車を止めて、"
2015003,"00:01:13.426","00:01:17.419","1","「この手紙をとった、○○さんは、この手紙を受け取って、」"
2015003,"00:01:17.605","00:01:19.979","1","「じーんときてくれるかしら。」なんて思いながら、"
2015003,"00:01:20.479","00:01:25.181","1","そのまんま、車置いて帰っちゃったもので、車が開けっ放しだったんです。"
2015003,"00:01:25.181","00:01:25.633","2","うーん。"
2015003,"00:01:25.686","00:01:29.892","1","それで、バッテリーが上がってしまってて、車が動かなくって。"
2015003,"00:01:31.223","00:01:36.692","1","それで、何万とかかって、お金がかかってしまって、ほんとに困ったんですが。"
2015003,"00:01:36.692","00:01:40.118","1","さて、それはともかくその一週間後。"
2015003,"00:01:40.251","00:01:42.740","1","また、同じスーパーに行こうと思って、"
2015003,"00:01:42.736","00:01:45.924","1","また、駐車場に行ったら、また車がなくって、"
2015003,"00:01:45.932","00:01:47.721","1","また、店に、飛び込んで、"
2015003,"00:01:47.801","00:01:51.865","1","また番頭さんに「車がないわよ、今度こそ、本当に盗られたのよ。」って言うと、"
2015003,"00:01:51.984","00:01:53.905","1","だーれも相手にしてくれなくって。"
2015003,"00:01:53.923","00:01:57.005","1","「奥さん、昨日の行動よく考えてみてくださいよ。」って言うんですよ。"
2015003,"00:01:57.029","00:02:01.145","1","それで、私もよーく考えてみたら、あ、ポストに行って、"
2015003,"00:02:01.748","00:02:05.686","1","もう一回あの方に手紙を出したんだって、気がづいたので、"
2015003,"00:02:05.689","00:02:07.068","1","急いで走って行きました。"
2015003,"00:02:07.275","00:02:14.626","1","そしたらば、今度は、駐車違反のなんか黄色い輪っかの、ぞうさんの耳みたいのをはめられていて、"
2015003,"00:02:14.685","00:02:19.120","1","すぐに、警察に出頭、って書いてあったので私は、"
2015003,"00:02:19.503","00:02:22.292","1","生まれて、かつてないぐらい落ち込んでしまって。"
2015003,"00:02:22.525","00:02:25.855","1","落ち込んだのは、車を忘れたことじゃなくて、"
2015003,"00:02:26.013","00:02:30.042","1","一週間前にも車を忘れたことを全然思い出さなかったんです。"
2015003,"00:02:30.250","00:02:32.922","1","それから、自分が昨日も車を、"
2015003,"00:02:32.989","00:02:38.234","1","ポストに手紙を出すのに忘れたっていうことを、全然思い出さなかったんで、"
2015003,"00:02:38.526","00:02:41.022","1","もう、これは、とうとう来たか。"
2015003,"00:02:41.230","00:02:44.935","1","やっぱり兆候はあったけど、ぼけたんだって、本気で思いました。"
2015003,"00:02:45.341","00:02:50.403","1","それで、とぼとぼとぼとぼ、足引きずるようにして、警察署まで行くと、"
2015003,"00:02:50.911","00:02:54.433","1","受付に、２０代のかわいい女の子が二人待ってたんで、"
2015003,"00:02:54.633","00:02:58.887","1","あのー、受付してたんで、「すみません、ちょっと私の顔見てください。」"
2015003,"00:02:59.849","00:03:02.805","1","「ぼけた顔してますか？」って聞いたんです。"
2015003,"00:03:02.821","00:03:07.217","1","そしたら二人とも「えっ。」て言ったので、「いやかくかくしかじかなんですよ。」"
2015003,"00:03:07.217","00:03:08.150","1","って言ったら、"
2015003,"00:03:08.275","00:03:11.447","1","「あ、大丈夫ですよ、普通の顔してますよ。」"
2015003,"00:03:12.229","00:03:14.452","1","ああ、良かった。ぼけてはまだいないんだ。"
2015003,"00:03:14.674","00:03:18.895","1","「でも、やっぱり車忘れたっていうのは、ちょっとぼけですよね。」"
2015003,"00:03:18.879","00:03:21.626","1","って言うと、受付の婦警さんが、"
2015003,"00:03:21.674","00:03:26.686","1","「そんなことありませんよ。私たちだって、毎日やってますよ、ねえ」って、"
2015003,"00:03:26.736","00:03:29.142","1","二人で「うん！」って言ってくれたんで、"
2015003,"00:03:29.200","00:03:32.047","1","ああ、これからは特別区民税しっかり払おうって思ったんですが、"
2015003,"00:03:32.047","00:03:33.511","1","まそれはともかく、"
2015003,"00:03:33.658","00:03:38.312","1","それで、「え、あなたたちも車毎日忘れてるの？ああ、良かった。」って"
2015003,"00:03:38.312","00:03:42.866","1","「いえ、車はなんかは忘れませんよ。忘れてるのはボールペンとか、」"
2015003,"00:03:42.916","00:03:45.805","1","「携帯とか、ですよね。」って言うんで、"
2015003,"00:03:45.955","00:03:49.343","1","「ほらやっぱり、車は忘れないんじゃない。車忘れるって変じゃない？」"
2015003,"00:03:49.433","00:03:54.553","1","「そんなことありませんよ。ボールペンも、携帯も、みんな忘れるけれども、」"
2015003,"00:03:54.528","00:03:55.136","2","（笑）"
2015003,"00:03:55.228","00:03:58.766","1","「車はたまたま大きいから目立っちゃっただけの話で、」"
2015003,"00:03:58.808","00:04:01.771","1","「全然ボールペンを忘れるのと、同じことです。」"
2015003,"00:04:01.805","00:04:05.117","1","って、言ってくれたんです。それで私は、"
2015003,"00:04:05.242","00:04:08.414","1","ああ、なんて優しい人たちなんだろう。そうだなぁ、"
2015003,"00:04:08.672","00:04:11.943","1","ほんとにそうだなぁと思って、立ち直れました。"
2015003,"00:04:12.074","00:04:16.145","1","でも、そう思ってくれなかった夫が、とっても非難してて、"
2015003,"00:04:16.170","00:04:17.119","2","（笑）"
2015003,"00:04:17.128","00:04:19.484","1","その日の晩、私がテレビを見てましたら、"

2015003,"00:04:28.347","00:04:32.161","1","やっぱり私のことをみんな理解してくれてるわけではないと思いました。"
2015003,"00:04:32.495","00:04:33.436","1","というわけで。"
2015003,"00:04:33.436","00:04:34.021","2","（笑）"
2015004,"00:00:00.116","00:00:04.571","1","あのー、１つはおじさんの話なんですけど。"

f2015019,"00:03:09.80","00:03:14.39","1","でも彼女は、えーっと、なんか僕に負けま、負けないように"
f2015019,"00:03:15.71","00:03:17.47","1","お前の妻こそばかだ。"

f2015019,"00:03:22.65","00:03:27.65","1","だ、おー、その話を聞いて僕は急に目覚めました。"
f2015019,"00:03:28.97","00:03:32.69","1","え、なんか変だなあ、と思うようになりました。"

f2015019,"00:03:39.32","00:03:40.82","1","同じってことじゃないですか。"

f2015019,"00:04:16.21","00:04:16.92","1","以上です。"
f2015020,"00:00:00.84","00:00:01.49","1","こんにちは"
f2015020,"00:00:02.14","00:00:05.68","1","きょう私は、ペットについて少し話したいと思います。"
f2015020,"00:00:06.84","00:00:12.93","1","私が子供の頃の夢は、ペット、特にゴールデンレトリーバーを飼うことでした。"
f2015020,"00:00:14.16","00:00:18.72","1","けれど、ゴールデンレトリーバーはかなり大きな犬なので"
f2015020,"00:00:19.26","00:00:24.08","1","その頃私たち家族が住んでいた香港のマンションで飼うことは無理でした。"
f2015020,"00:00:25.08","00:00:29.75","1","オーストラリアに戻ってからなら、と思い楽しみにしていましたが、"
f2015020,"00:00:30.86","00:00:35.91","1","帰った直後、父の目が見えなくなり、犬を飼うことができなくなりました。"
f2015020,"00:00:37.42","00:00:40.94","1","しかし、鳥を飼うのは無理ではありませんでした。"
f2015020,"00:00:41.90","00:00:44.03","1","なので、私は十二年前、"
f2015020,"00:00:44.79","00:00:50.15","1","チコ、という黄色のラブバードの飼い主になりました。"
f2015020,"00:00:51.57","00:00:56.01","1","実は私のチコは、家族の中で三代目のチコでした。"
f2015020,"00:00:57.63","00:01:03.60","1","最初のチコは、私の母が子どもの頃に買っていたラブバードで、飛べなかったのですが、"
f2015020,"00:01:04.05","00:01:06.90","1","勝手にかごの戸を開けて、"
f2015020,"00:01:07.26","00:01:12.82","1","歩き回ったり、お風呂に二、三秒つかったり、よく慣れていたそうです。"
f2015020,"00:01:13.75","00:01:19.70","1","でも飛べなかったので、運動不足のためコレステロールが高くなって死んでしまいました。"
f2015020,"00:01:21.68","00:01:24.52","1","二代目のチコも、かなり変わった鳥でした。"
f2015020,"00:01:25.24","00:01:30.82","1","このチコは、私の両親がオーストラリアで、雛の時から飼っていたラブバードで、"
f2015020,"00:01:31.39","00:01:34.18","1","よく慣れていて、飛び回っていましたが、"
f2015020,"00:01:34.63","00:01:36.54","1","食事中に飛んできて"
f2015020,"00:01:36.68","00:01:41.10","1","鳥が食べてはいけないようなものを、しょっちゅう食べていました。"
f2015020,"00:01:41.84","00:01:44.90","1","ですから、このチコも長生きしませんでした。"
f2015020,"00:01:46.76","00:01:54.90","1","三代目のチコは、今からえっと一年半前にに死にましたが、結構長生きでした。"
f2015020,"00:01:55.55","00:01:59.71","1","ただ、私のチコはあまり人に懐きませんでした。"
f2015020,"00:02:00.59","00:02:06.78","1","かっ、え餌をあげる時に、指をかもうとしたり、肩に乗っても、耳をつついたり、"
f2015020,"00:02:07.52","00:02:13.77","1","気が荒く、ラブバード、つまり愛の鳥、とは正反対な性格でした。"
f2015020,"00:02:14.69","00:02:18.80","1","けれど、チコの性格はともかく、私はチコを愛してました。"
f2015020,"00:02:19.72","00:02:24.99","1","チコが死んだ二、三日前に起こった、心に残る思い出があります。"
f2015020,"00:02:25.78","00:02:31.05","1","この時、私はチコのかごからずうっと離れた部屋でコンピュータを使っていました。"
f2015020,"00:02:31.93","00:02:34.31","1","すると、何か音がしたのです。"
f2015020,"00:02:35.33","00:02:40.03","1","気が付くと、チコが私のすぐそばにいて、肩に飛んできました。"
f2015020,"00:02:40.92","00:02:46.20","1","それから私の髪の毛の中にもぐりこんで、じいっとそこにいてくれました。"
f2015020,"00:02:47.37","00:02:53.61","1","それまで一度も無かったことで、私は今でもその時の感覚を忘れられません。"
f2015020,"00:02:54.95","00:03:00.16","1","もしかしたら、私はそのうち四代目のチコを飼うようになるかもしれません。"
f2015020,"00:03:01.10","00:03:06.14","1","しかし、あの時のチコや、変わった性格のことを思うと、"
f2015020,"00:03:06.77","00:03:11.26","1","新しい鳥やペットを飼うのは、むずこ難しいことだと思います。"
f2015020,"00:03:12.04","00:03:12.67","1","以上です。"
f2015021,"00:00:01.29","00:00:02.20","1","皆さんこんにちは。"
f2015021,"00:00:02.50","00:00:10.10","1","えこれは、私の高校時代のことでストーリーの主役は、親友の＊＊という女の子だった。"
f2015021,"00:00:10.74","00:00:15.11","1","そして、彼女はちょっと大雑把だったが実は優しい人だった。"
f2015021,"00:00:15.74","00:00:18.18","1","モルモットを飼っている彼女にとっては、"
f2015021,"00:00:18.66","00:00:23.30","1","なんかネズミなどは怖いものではなく、むしろ友達のような存在で、"
f2015021,"00:00:23.53","00:00:26.62","1","いつもモルモットやネズミに興味を持っていた。"
f2015021,"00:00:27.53","00:00:30.18","1","ある日、彼女は学校に来る途中で、"
f2015021,"00:00:30.57","00:00:35.66","1","あの、ある足に傷を受けたネズミを見て悲しく思っていました。"
f2015021,"00:00:36.70","00:00:42.37","1","そしてあの、あのネズミの面倒をみろうと、なんか心のな中で決めたが、"
f2015021,"00:00:42.67","00:00:46.83","1","あのネズミはなんか、＊＊のことを嫌がっているように見えて、"
f2015021,"00:00:47.08","00:00:50.27","1","＊＊が用意したものを少しも食べなかったから、"
f2015021,"00:00:50.82","00:00:54.80","1","えー、だんだんネズミがね、弱くなってきて、動けなくなった。"
f2015021,"00:00:55.57","00:01:02.31","1","そして＊＊はこの状況を見ると、せめて私はあなたのそばにいてあげたい、最後まで、"
f2015021,"00:01:02.77","00:01:07.52","1","という気持ちで、ねんごろにあのネズミをほ葬ったが、"
f2015021,"00:01:08.09","00:01:14.21","1","＊＊は、あのネズミがまだ生きているのか死んでいるのかとういうことを確認するするのを忘れたから、"
f2015021,"00:01:14.70","00:01:18.48","1","なんか、生き埋めにしちゃたかなと＊＊は心配しました。"
f2015021,"00:01:19.34","00:01:24.68","1","そして翌日、なんか自責のせいか、＊＊は昼寝をする時に、"
f2015021,"00:01:24.91","00:01:28.44","1","あの生き埋めされる可能性があるネズミの夢を見た。"
f2015021,"00:01:29.12","00:01:35.14","1","夢の中で、あのネズミはナイフを持って＊＊をおい追いかけて殺そうとした。"
f2015021,"00:01:35.58","00:01:38.39","1","そして＊＊ももちろん、謝りながら逃げ始めた。"
f2015021,"00:01:38.98","00:01:43.42","1","すると、はっとなんかぶつけたように大きいが音が出たから、"
f2015021,"00:01:43.93","00:01:46.61","1","なんか、＊＊もびっくりして目覚めた。"
f2015021,"00:01:47.10","00:01:50.38","1","その瞬間に足に激しい痛みを感じた。"
f2015021,"00:01:51.11","00:01:57.04","1","なんと、＊＊は本当に夢遊病で歩き出して、そして椅子につまずいて、"
f2015021,"00:01:57.51","00:01:58.89","1","なんか転んだのだから。"
f2015021,"00:01:59.39","00:02:04.42","1","そして結局、＊＊は病院に行って一週間車椅子を使った。"
f2015021,"00:02:05.01","00:02:06.45","1","なんか骨折しましたから。"
f2015021,"00:02:06.96","00:02:09.76","1","なんかそして夢遊病で骨折するなんて、"
f2015021,"00:02:09.97","00:02:12.78","1","お医者さんにとっても初めての珍事だった。"
f2015021,"00:02:13.16","00:02:14.97","1","そしてクラスメートの皆さんにとっても、"
f2015021,"00:02:15.22","00:02:17.60","1","なんかこういうことは確かにかわいそうだったが、"
f2015021,"00:02:17.93","00:02:19.09","1","こらえきれず笑っちゃった。"
f2015021,"00:02:19.36","00:02:21.98","1","だってこれは確かに＊＊らしいことだった。"
f2015021,"00:02:23.05","00:02:23.59","1","え、以上です。"
f2015022,"00:00:00.48","00:00:01.75","1","はい、皆さんこんにちは。"

f2015023,"00:00:01.66","00:00:02.68","1","みなさんこんにちは。"
f2015023,"00:00:03.34","00:00:07.52","1","日本語を勉強している外国人なら、日本のポップソングを聞いたことが"
f2015023,"00:00:07.66","00:00:11.96","1","少なくとも、いち、い、一回とか二回ぐらいある、あると思います。"
f2015023,"00:00:12.41","00:00:15.28","1","日本のポップソングをＪポップといいます。"
f2015023,"00:00:15.78","00:00:21.29","1","そして今回私が言いたい、あー面白いことがそのＪポップです。"
f2015023,"00:00:22.48","00:00:27.51","1","二年前高校を卒業した自分が日本語の勉強をはじま、始めました。"
f2015023,"00:00:28.63","00:00:32.61","1","あのとき、日本語勉強のためにＪポップも聞き始めました。"
f2015023,"00:00:33.33","00:00:38.01","1","そして、さまざまないい曲と、あーすばらしい歌手と出会って、"
f2015023,"00:00:38.40","00:00:40.07","1","Ｊポップを好きになりました。"

f2015023,"00:00:58.61","00:01:00.76","1","自分の日常の一部になりました。"

f2015023,"00:01:04.33","00:01:06.93","1","Ｊポップのちょっと変な所が見つかりました。"
f2015023,"00:01:07.34","00:01:09.24","1","それは歌詞です。"
f2015023,"00:01:10.44","00:01:13.49","1","Ｊポップにはありがちな歌詞が多すぎます。"
f2015023,"00:01:14.16","00:01:16.81","1","例えば、時間はあの夏の日。"
f2015023,"00:01:17.49","00:01:20.00","1","人物は不器用な僕たち。"

f2015024,"00:00:19.00","00:00:26.11","1","で、私がまず、また中学、あー中学生のころ、物理いわゆる理科のその授業が大の苦手で、"

f2015029,"00:00:42.72","00:00:44.66","1","ずっと座り込んでいましたから。"
f2015029,"00:00:44.97","00:00:48.51","1","で、私は心配して、お兄さんの家を訪ねました。"

f2015029,"00:01:20.98","00:01:22.59","1","で、お散歩は、"

f2015029,"00:01:27.13","00:01:29.23","1","と私はお兄さんに聞いたら、"

f2015029,"00:01:36.85","00:01:43.45","1","で話をしてると、あー話をしてると、クロちゃんがここにやって来ました。"
f2015029,"00:01:43.86","00:01:46.54","1","で、まーあー真ん中"

f2015029,"00:01:58.03","00:02:01.83","1","自分の後ろ二本足をこうやって開きました。"
f2015029,"00:02:02.27","00:02:05.96","1","ふと、私は何をやってるかよくわからなくて、"
f2015029,"00:02:06.59","00:02:10.12","1","今度は、隣のお兄さんが急に立ち上がり"
f2015029,"00:02:10.47","00:02:12.92","1","クロちゃん、今すぐ散歩に行こう。"

f2015029,"00:02:22.60","00:02:27.37","1","雄犬がおしっこする前のポーズじゃないかと思ったんです。"
f2015029,"00:02:28.03","00:02:31.42","1","で、クロちゃんは本当にすごい犬だと思います。"
f2015029,"00:02:31.54","00:02:34.65","1","あとで、犬から、あ、あとでお兄さんから"
f2015029,"00:02:34.87","00:02:38.71","1","他のうちの犬もこうやって散歩したくて、"
f2015029,"00:02:38.96","00:02:42.27","1","二本足をこうやって開いているかって聞いたら私たぶん、"
f2015029,"00:02:42.55","00:02:43.56","1","ないだと思います。"
f2015029,"00:02:43.74","00:02:44.74","1","と答えました。"
f2015029,"00:02:45.27","00:02:48.99","1","で本当にクロちゃんは特別な存在だと思います。"

f2015030,"00:00:32.99","00:00:36.30","1","日本ではあまり、しらてない知られてないそうですから、"
f2015030,"00:00:36.63","00:00:38.78","1","きょう皆さんに紹介したいと思いました。"
f2015030,"00:00:39.48","00:00:45.98","1","まずトランプリンはなんのかと言うと、簡単で言うと、弾力性のあるマットのことで"
f2015030,"00:00:46.43","00:00:50.58","1","で、その上で飛び、飛び跳ねることで楽しめるものです。"
f2015030,"00:00:51.15","00:00:53.51","1","そしてトランプリンパークというのは、"
f2015030,"00:00:53.83","00:00:58.42","1","トランプリンだらけの、倉庫のように広いな所で、"
f2015030,"00:00:59.05","00:00:59.89","1","そういうものです。"

f2015030,"00:01:06.62","00:01:10.27","1","たくさんの遊び方でトランプリンを楽しめることができます。"
f2015030,"00:01:10.87","00:01:16.35","1","例えば、バスケットボールのゴールが設置されていますので、"

f2015030,"00:01:23.43","00:01:28.74","1","そして私が一番好きなのは、スポンジフィットも設置されています。"
f2015030,"00:01:29.17","00:01:31.30","1","スポンジフィットはなんのかというと、"
f2015030,"00:01:32.19","00:01:37.19","1","つまり、水の代わりにスポンジに満たされたプールのことです。"
f2015030,"00:01:37.62","00:01:43.85","1","そして、トランプリンからいかにはげしはげしても、飛び込んでも、怪我しないので、"
f2015030,"00:01:44.16","00:01:52.39","1","思いっ切り、バックフィットやいろいろなわざを使ってみて楽しめることができます。"

f2015030,"00:02:16.04","00:02:20.59","1","体験できますが、でも最も面白いなと思ったのは、"
f2015030,"00:02:21.38","00:02:26.35","1","最近、オーストラリアのトランプリンパークで出来上がったイベントのことです。"
f2015030,"00:02:26.81","00:02:33.20","1","そのイベントでは、でぃ、ディスコライトやＤＪもいるから、"
f2015030,"00:02:33.52","00:02:37.83","1","まるでダンスパーティみたいなの雰囲気でトランプリンを、"
f2015030,"00:02:38.17","00:02:42.62","1","楽しめることができますが、それは安全かどうかよく分からないです。"

f2015037,"00:00:29.001","00:00:32.853","1","そのため、２年生のみんながー、３、４人で、グループを組んで、"

f2015037,"00:00:45.612","00:00:47.879","1","そのあと、みんなで、ゲームをしました。"
f2015037,"00:00:48.685","00:00:51.368","1","ゲームは、日本語ーに翻訳したら、"

f2015037,"00:01:11.851","00:01:13.905","1","ちょっと一緒に想像してください。"
f2015037,"00:01:14.755","00:01:16.234","1","まずは、準備です。"
f2015037,"00:01:16.638","00:01:22.164","1","まず、遊び場、が、白いチョークの線でー、２つに分けられています。"

f2015037,"00:01:36.173","00:01:38.865","1","そこ、１列に、並んでいます。"
f2015037,"00:01:39.559","00:01:43.278","1","ま、今準備がー終わりますので、ゲームを始めましょう。"
f2015037,"00:01:44.633","00:01:45.545","1","っとねー、"
f2015037,"00:01:46.390","00:01:50.632","1","毎回始まりに、センターに立っている子どもが、"
f2015037,"00:01:51.376","00:01:54.652","1","船長にー、渡る許可を、もお願いします。"
f2015037,"00:01:55.346","00:01:59.951","1","船長が、そのため、ルールを１つ考えて、みなに伝えます。"
f2015037,"00:02:00.562","00:02:01.740","1","ルールは例えば、"
f2015037,"00:02:02.523","00:02:06.676","1","片足だけ、で走っている子どもは渡れる、ことです。"
f2015037,"00:02:08.447","00:02:11.741","1","でも、もし、ルールが守れないなら、"
f2015037,"00:02:13.950","00:02:17.332","1","むかえに、一生懸命走る、しか、ありません。"
f2015037,"00:02:18.621","00:02:23.580","1","でもールールにしたがないで、船長に、タッチされたら、"
f2015037,"00:02:23.624","00:02:26.927","1","されたら、あなたも、船長になって、"
f2015037,"00:02:28.427","00:02:33.678","1","一緒にー、船長と一緒にー、他の子ども達を捕らえなくては、いけません。"
f2015037,"00:02:34.089","00:02:35.976","1","ま、いいアイディアですね。"
f2015037,"00:02:36.232","00:02:42.316","1","そうおもながらー僕と同級生が、船長の役果たして、ゲームを始めました。"
f2015037,"00:02:43.006","00:02:43.733","1","ただし。"

f2016010,"00:00:20.58","00:00:21.09","1","で、"
f2016010,"00:00:21.63","00:00:23.87","1","あの、空港に向かっていましたね。"
f2016010,"00:00:24.31","00:00:24.99","1","そうしまし、"
f2016010,"00:00:25.97","00:00:27.79","1","したら、そのー途中で、"
f2016010,"00:00:28.20","00:00:30.96","1","携帯がいき、いきなり壊れてしまったんです。"
f2016010,"00:00:32.27","00:00:33.39","1","なんか何度も、"

f2016010,"00:00:39.54","00:00:43.65","1","で、すごく緊張しました。なぜかというと、私は方向音痴で、"
f2016010,"00:00:44.70","00:00:49.54","1","なんか、あんまり、あの記憶もあんまりよくないので、どうやって空港まで行けばいいのか"

f2016010,"00:00:51.73","00:00:53.24","1","ちょっとわからなかったんですね。"
f2016010,"00:00:54.11","00:00:59.27","1","なので、なんかいろんな人に聞いて、やっと成田空港まで着きました。"
f2016010,"00:00:59.88","00:01:04.76","1","でも、そうし、しましたら、またもう一つの問題がそうじてしまった。"

f2016010,"00:01:19.92","00:01:22.29","1","に乗ってるときに、隣に座っていた"

f2016010,"00:01:44.34","00:01:47.35","1","あの一応メッセージを送って、待っていました。"
f2016010,"00:01:47.84","00:01:50.77","1","でも、ずっと待っても返事が来なかったので"
f2016010,"00:01:51.32","00:01:56.64","1","そのときに、「あ、どうしよう。どうしたら家族と連絡できるんだろう」って思ったときに、"

f2016025,"00:01:05.33","00:01:06.70","1","で、その日から"

f2016037,"00:00:41.11","00:00:41.63","1","でも、"

f2016037,"00:01:18.90","00:01:20.91","1","そのあとでこのように飲みます。"
f2016037,"00:01:32.60","00:01:33.79","1","見たとおりすごいでしょ？"
f2016037,"00:01:35.27","00:01:39.31","1","でも、この飲み方は、今でも名前はありません。"
f2016037,"00:01:41.86","00:01:47.19","1","スナイパーみたいに、ながいところからはずれない人は最強ですから、"
f2016037,"00:01:48.11","00:01:51.54","1","あのー、「飲みスナイパー」と呼んでいいかもしれません。"
f2016037,"00:01:52.71","00:01:53.35","1","そして、"
f2016037,"00:01:54.59","00:02:00.11","1","最初に「飲みスナイパー」というのは、変な飲み方だけでしたけど、"
f2016037,"00:02:00.40","00:02:01.21","1","私は、"

f2016037,"00:02:44.11","00:02:51.02","1","恐らく、一番いい考えじゃなかったですけど、私も「飲みスナイパー」をしました。"
f2016037,"00:02:52.49","00:02:53.64","1","でも私は"

2017013,"00:03:59.62","00:04:00.89","1","避けられないですよ。"
2017013,"00:04:02.40","00:04:06.29","1","変な、変なおじさんだなと思って、ま、しょうがないと思って。"
2017013,"00:04:06.58","00:04:12.22","1","私、ま、おじさんの隣の部屋に入って、で用をたして、でトイレから出たんです。"
2017013,"00:04:12.73","00:04:14.45","1","で出たら、もうおじさんいない。"

2017013,"00:04:28.21","00:04:29.42","1","「ヨウジャ」って書いてある。"
2017013,"00:04:29.33","00:04:29.87","3","ヨジャ？"
2017013,"00:04:31.96","00:04:33.66","1","分かりますか？「ヨジャ」って。"
2017013,"00:04:34.87","00:04:39.76","1","つまり、さっきおじさんだと思った人は、実はおばさんだったと。"
2017013,"00:04:39.96","00:04:42.55","2","ああー。"
2017013,"00:04:42.08","00:04:43.18","1","お話です。"

2017013,"00:04:52.29","00:04:53.96","1","私、女子トイレ入ったんです。"
2017013,"00:04:53.70","00:04:57.53","2","（笑）"
2017014,"00:00:01.76","00:00:04.78","1","私の２０年来の友達の話なんですけどね、"
2017014,"00:00:05.63","00:00:10.36","1","彼女は、えー性格がとっても暖かで、愉快で、"
2017014,"00:00:10.97","00:00:14.61","1","えーそして、率直で無欲で魅力的な人なんです。"
2017014,"00:00:15.00","00:00:16.74","1","ただ、うかつなんです。"
2017014,"00:00:17.67","00:00:22.52","1","えー、親しい友達がみんな既に知ってる、とっくに知ってるようなことを、"
2017014,"00:00:22.77","00:00:27.87","1","彼女はだけはどういう訳か知らなかったり、気付いていなかったりする、そういうことがよくあります。"
2017014,"00:00:28.85","00:00:34.58","1","ま、うかつなんていうことは彼女の魅力を考えると、全然大したことじゃないんですけれども。"
2017014,"00:00:35.11","00:00:37.05","1","本人はちょっと気にしてます。"
2017014,"00:00:38.37","00:00:42.86","1","で、ある時、えー家の近所を二人で歩いている時に、彼女が言い出しました。"
2017014,"00:00:43.36","00:00:48.40","1","「ねえねえ、学校の近くの坂の途中に、草ぼうぼうの空き地があったじゃない。"
2017014,"00:00:48.70","00:00:54.46","1","あそこに家が建って、もう一家が住み始めてるの知ってた？」て言うんです。"
2017014,"00:00:54.83","00:01:01.98","1","「えっ、知らなかった、そうなの？」と私が言うと、彼女がにっこり笑って「そうなの。」"
2017014,"00:01:02.62","00:01:06.33","1","「ボブっていう犬もいてね、もう友達になっちゃってね。」"
2017014,"00:01:07.10","00:01:12.31","1","「ボブちゃんって呼ぶといっつも出てきて、しばらく遊んでやるのよ。」って言うんです。"
2017014,"00:01:13.17","00:01:14.62","1","「そうなんだ。」"
2017014,"00:01:15.60","00:01:17.32","1","「えっ、じゃあ紹介してあげようか？」"
2017014,"00:01:18.31","00:01:20.95","1","そういうことになって二人で早速行ってみました。"
2017014,"00:01:22.67","00:01:26.98","1","行ってみると、こないだまで草ぼうぼうだった所にこぎれいな家が建ってます。"
2017014,"00:01:27.55","00:01:30.33","1","で確かに玄関先で犬が寝てました。"
2017014,"00:01:31.19","00:01:38.35","1","友達が「ボブちゃん、ボブちゃん」っていかにもお友達っていう調子で名前を呼ぶと、"
2017014,"00:01:38.90","00:01:42.55","1","犬はむくっと起き上がってぱたぱたしっぽを振りながら来ました。"
2017014,"00:01:43.62","00:01:46.83","1","フェンスのとこで友達は一生懸命、可愛がっています。"
2017014,"00:01:47.56","00:01:51.28","1","「あ、ほんとだ、可愛い、愛嬌のあるいい仔だね。」"
2017014,"00:01:51.77","00:01:56.54","1","「ねえねえ、ボブちゃんて名前は、ここの家の奥さんにならったの、"
2017014,"00:01:56.55","00:01:58.97","1","奥さんとももうお友達になったわけ？」"
2017014,"00:01:59.58","00:02:03.77","1","って聞くと、友達は黙ってすっと指をさします。"
2017014,"00:02:04.50","00:02:07.57","1","「えっ」て言うと、「ほら、見てごらんよ。」"
2017014,"00:02:08.15","00:02:16.12","1","「犬小屋の三角の屋根の下の所に書いてあるじゃない、ボブハウスって。」て言うんです。"
2017014,"00:02:17.78","00:02:26.20","1","指す方向を見てみると、確かに、えー、屋根のすぐ下に英語でボブハウスって書いてありました。"
2017014,"00:02:27.88","00:02:36.47","1","でもそれはどう見ても、プロの手によって印刷された、えー、商標のシールなんですね。"
2017014,"00:02:37.17","00:02:41.99","1","つまりボブハウスっていうのは犬小屋の製品名。"
2017014,"00:02:44.07","00:02:48.88","1","ボブ君はちっともボブじゃなかったっていうお話です。"
2017015,"00:00:02.45","00:00:05.48","1","もう１５年ぐらい前の話になるんですけれども、"
2017015,"00:00:06.61","00:00:13.67","1","友達が要り用があって一生懸命探していた品物を、たまたま私が持っていることが分かって、"
2017015,"00:00:14.03","00:00:16.44","1","それをお貸しするという約束になりました。"
2017015,"00:00:17.70","00:00:22.06","1","家に帰った私は、こういうことは善は急げだなって思って、"
2017015,"00:00:22.27","00:00:25.89","1","早速に彼女の家にそれを届けることに決めました。"
2017015,"00:00:26.35","00:00:28.69","1","もう夕暮れ時だったんですけれどもね。"
2017015,"00:00:29.61","00:00:35.64","1","で、彼女の家に行くと、まあ、そんなにすぐに私が来ると思ってませんから、"
2017015,"00:00:36.01","00:00:39.32","1","友達は驚くやら喜ぶやらでした。"
2017015,"00:00:40.07","00:00:44.82","1","それで「ちょっと待ってね。」って言うなり家の中に引っ込んでしまうんです。"
2017015,"00:00:45.50","00:00:51.20","1","で、中からはぱたぱたぱたぱたと家の中、駆け回るスリッパの足音が聞こえてきます。"
2017015,"00:00:52.28","00:00:59.83","1","ああ、これは私に何か、うーんお土産のようなものを持たせようとしてるんだな。"
2017015,"00:01:00.55","00:01:06.28","1","何しろ突然私が現れたんだから困ってるだろうな、そう思ったもんですから。"
2017015,"00:01:07.05","00:01:12.87","1","「ご飯時だし、もう帰るね、またね。」とだけ言いおいて、私は立ち去ることにしたんです。"
2017015,"00:01:13.93","00:01:21.92","1","すると後ろから「待ってー」って友達が大きな声で、えー、言って、玄関からぱっと出てきました。"
2017015,"00:01:23.15","00:01:26.84","1","振り返ると手に、ま、きれいな紙袋を下げてるんです。"
2017015,"00:01:27.22","00:01:32.95","1","「待って待って、おいしいお菓子を食べてもらいたくて持ってきたの。」って彼女は言います。"
2017015,"00:01:34.23","00:01:41.52","1","「これね、北海道の親戚から送ってきたばっかりなんだけれども、有名なお菓子屋さんの新製品なんだって。"
2017015,"00:01:41.98","00:01:46.37","1","それでもう店頭に並ぶとすぐに売り切れるぐらいの大人気でね。"
2017015,"00:01:47.25","00:01:51.04","1","そりゃあ、珍しいお菓子なの、食べたことのないようなものなの。"
2017015,"00:01:51.17","00:01:59.55","1","苺が丸のまんまフリーズドライで、こうふわっと空気みたいに軽く仕上がってて、"
2017015,"00:01:59.83","00:02:02.83","1","それを薄くチョコがコートしてて、"
2017015,"00:02:03.14","00:02:05.84","1","それはそれはおいしいから食べてみて。」"
2017015,"00:02:07.09","00:02:08.28","1","私に手渡すんです。"
2017015,"00:02:09.22","00:02:11.59","1","確かにかるーい紙袋でした。"
2017015,"00:02:12.73","00:02:16.43","1","えー、なんか聞いただけでおいしそうだなと思った私は"
2017015,"00:02:16.98","00:02:22.66","1","「じゃあ、食べてみたくなっちゃった、頂くね。」って言ってそれをもらって帰ることにしました。"
2017015,"00:02:24.08","00:02:25.48","1","帰り道、ご機嫌です。"
2017015,"00:02:25.70","00:02:31.52","1","どんなかな、あー、おいしんだろうな、食べてみたいな。"
2017015,"00:02:32.15","00:02:36.45","1","ちょうど、えー夕暮れ時でお腹が空いていたこともあって。"
2017015,"00:02:37.87","00:02:42.80","1","もう一粒食べてみようって、急に思い立ちました。"
2017015,"00:02:43.72","00:02:52.95","1","え、街灯の下で立ち止まると、周りに人も歩いていませんし、早速、えー、袋の中から箱を取り出しました。"
2017015,"00:02:53.35","00:02:54.88","1","円筒形の紙箱でした。"
2017015,"00:02:55.22","00:02:56.24","1","とっても軽かった。"
2017015,"00:02:57.22","00:03:03.49","1","それを、どれどれっという気持ちで覗き込みながら、ぱかっと開けてみると、"
2017015,"00:03:05.12","00:03:08.42","1","中は真っ白でした、空だったんです。"
2017015,"00:03:11.26","00:03:16.42","1","まあ、たぶん友達んちの子どもが、ママに内緒で全部食べちゃったんでしょうね。"
2017015,"00:03:19.47","00:03:29.23","1","空箱を持ったまま、まだ期待に満ちた顔をしたまんまで突っ立っている自分、ほんとに間抜けでした。"
f2017016,"00:00:01.18","00:00:08.35","1","と、すいませんが、ちょっと、すごい、すごい短い、短い話しか、もう思いつかなくて。"
f2017016,"00:00:08.51","00:00:18.56","1","それはなんか日本に初めて来た時、ちょうど、そのー、ド、ドラッグストアでバイトをしていたんですが、"

f2017019,"00:00:01.08","00:00:02.45","1","皆さんこんにちは。"
f2017019,"00:00:02.75","00:00:09.38","1","今日、私がお話したいちょっと面白い話は「おはようございます」という言葉についてです。"
f2017019,"00:00:10.02","00:00:14.38","1","私は中学１年生の時から日本語を勉強し始めました。"
f2017019,"00:00:14.83","00:00:23.47","1","最初の時に先生に教わったことは、その「ですます」ていうのを、あ、ですます体の丁寧語でした。"
f2017019,"00:00:23.76","00:00:31.23","1","例えば「食べる」を「食べます」、「する」を「します」、「来る」を「来ます」のような言葉でした。"
f2017019,"00:00:31.50","00:00:36.46","1","もちろん、あいさつ言葉も「おはよう」ではなく「おはようございます」でした。"
f2017019,"00:00:37.18","00:00:41.77","1","え、その次にまた勉強したのは動詞の原形でした。"
f2017019,"00:00:42.47","00:00:46.66","1","えー、で、自分はその「食べます」を「食べる」、"
f2017019,"00:00:46.79","00:00:50.43","1","「します」を「する」、「来ます」を「来る」といったように、"
f2017019,"00:00:50.53","00:00:55.50","1","そのー、動詞の変形を工夫して練習しました。"
f2017019,"00:00:56.06","00:01:00.74","1","で、ある日、私は「ござる」という動詞に出会いました。"
f2017019,"00:01:00.80","00:01:04.20","1","でその時、真っ先に頭に浮かんできたのは、"
f2017019,"00:01:00.92","00:01:02.70","2","（笑）"
f2017019,"00:01:04.46","00:01:08.70","1","えっ、「おはようございます」のござい「ございます」の部分の原形は"
f2017019,"00:01:08.72","00:01:11.25","1","「ござる」のではないかと思いました。"
f2017019,"00:01:10.00","00:01:11.28","2","（笑）"
f2017019,"00:01:11.94","00:01:15.27","1","うーん、だから「おはようございます」のカジュアルな言い方は"
f2017019,"00:01:15.29","00:01:18.17","1","「おはようござる」かなって思いました。"
f2017019,"00:01:16.56","00:01:18.55","2","（笑）"
f2017019,"00:01:18.77","00:01:21.45","1","で、その話を自分の友達に話したら、"
f2017019,"00:01:21.50","00:01:25.89","1","みんな、なるほどていう顔をしてほんとに喜んでました。"
f2017019,"00:01:23.18","00:01:26.55","2","（笑）"
f2017019,"00:01:26.66","00:01:30.35","1","で、先生に確認したところ、結局、大間違いでした。"
f2017019,"00:01:31.27","00:01:32.94","1","で、そこで、私は、"
f2017019,"00:01:33.32","00:01:38.14","1","「おはようございます」という言葉に少し興味が、あ、興味を持つようになって、"
f2017019,"00:01:38.18","00:01:39.64","1","ネットで調べました。"
f2017019,"00:01:40.23","00:01:44.37","1","すると、その「おはようございます」の語源が出てきました。"
f2017019,"00:01:45.07","00:01:48.05","1","それはちょっと、皆さんに紹介したいと思ってます。"
f2017019,"00:01:48.33","00:01:52.16","1","えっとー、「おはようございます」の語源は実は歌舞伎にあります。"
f2017019,"00:01:52.68","00:01:58.11","1","そのー歌舞伎は一日中、公演をやっていますが、夕方ぐらいに、"
f2017019,"00:01:58.31","00:02:05.53","1","そのー座長につと、トリに務める座長が楽屋入りして、したま、下っ端の者が、"
f2017019,"00:02:05.63","00:02:11.55","1","そのー、あ、上にいる座長を迎える、出迎え、出迎える時に、"
f2017019,"00:02:11.81","00:02:17.48","1","「お早い」あー、「お早いおつきでございます。」と言って、そのー迎えます。"
f2017019,"00:02:18.03","00:02:21.77","1","で、その座長んー下の人たちに、"
f2017019,"00:02:22.96","00:02:27.00","1","自分よりも早い時間帯から公演をしている人たちに、"
f2017019,"00:02:27.20","00:02:32.69","1","その「お早い時間からご苦労様です」と挨拶しかえます。"
f2017019,"00:02:33.00","00:02:37.60","1","その２つの言葉の省略が「おはようございます」になります。"
f2017019,"00:02:38.23","00:02:42.15","1","えー、それが「おはようございます」の語源でした。"
f2017019,"00:02:42.72","00:02:43.78","1","はい、以上です。"

f2017022,"00:00:44.53","00:00:54.68","1","それで、それを私、私はその言葉を知ってから、去年から、あのー、日本人の友達と仲良くなるために、"
f2017022,"00:00:54.76","00:01:01.62","1","冗談で、えー、冗談でえー、「日本語食べません。」という言葉をよく使いました。"
f2017022,"00:01:01.71","00:01:07.65","1","例えば、「あなた、そんな言葉言わないの。」って言われた時に、"
f2017022,"00:01:07.92","00:01:17.70","1","「えー、日本語食べません。」とかを言ったら、みんなと笑いながら親しく、な、なれました。"

f2017022,"00:01:18.23","00:01:22.95","1","で、それをまたバイト先で使ったんですけど、"
f2017022,"00:01:23.52","00:01:28.10","1","え、なんか店長が「これはこうすればいいんだ。わかった？」"
f2017022,"00:01:28.27","00:01:35.08","1","「えー、日本語食べません。」とか言って店長とも仲良くなれたんですけど、"

f2017022,"00:01:34.65","00:01:35.55","2","（笑）"
f2017022,"00:01:35.52","00:01:38.32","1","で、それが使えなかった時があります。"
f2017022,"00:01:38.60","00:01:41.79","1","私が大間違いをしった時です。"
f2017022,"00:01:43.33","00:01:46.82","1","りゅうが、あー外国人がチャージをするために、"
f2017022,"00:01:47.17","00:01:52.71","1","えーコンビニでクレジットカードを、クレジットカードで払おうとしました。"
f2017022,"00:01:52.88","00:01:56.68","1","でも私がそれがわからなくて、できないことがわからなくて、"
f2017022,"00:01:56.88","00:02:02.70","1","ついやって３０００円をただでチャージして、ま、し、してしまいました。"
f2017022,"00:02:03.02","00:02:11.29","1","それで店長がえー、すごくどなってはなかったんですけど、すごく怒られたので、"
f2017022,"00:02:11.47","00:02:17.25","1","その時ではさすがに「日本語食べません。」は使えませんでした。（笑）"
f2017022,"00:02:15.91","00:02:17.53","2","（笑）"
f2017022,"00:02:17.67","00:02:18.62","1","使いませんでした。"
f2017022,"00:02:18.99","00:02:26.94","1","でも、あー、その時、あーこういう時はほんとに使ったらだめかもしれないと思って、"
f2017022,"00:02:27.24","00:02:34.51","1","その、それ以降から、ほんとに人が怒ってる時は、その言葉は使わなくて、"
f2017022,"00:02:34.68","00:02:40.17","1","ほんとに、んー、冗談が言えるときだけ、使っています。"
f2017022,"00:02:40.59","00:02:44.29","1","皆さんも、「日本語食べません。」を使ったら、"

f2017023,"00:00:10.74","00:00:17.14","1","結構、何だろう、韓国で一人暮らししてる人だったら、わりと分かるかもしれない話をしたいと思います。"
f2017023,"00:00:17.70","00:00:23.84","1","えっとー、これ私の話じゃなくて、あるすごい貧乏な一人暮らしの、だい、大学生の話なんですけど、"
f2017023,"00:00:24.45","00:00:29.81","1","あのー、ま、やっぱり貧乏で家賃出すのもすごく大変な人っていっぱいいるじゃないですか。"
f2017023,"00:00:30.03","00:00:36.13","1","で、しかも韓国ってすごく学費が高くて、まー結構借金しちゃったりしているもんで、"
f2017023,"00:00:36.54","00:00:38.29","1","あの生活、結構厳しいんですよ。"
f2017023,"00:00:38.66","00:00:42.60","1","で、その人は結構誕生日が近かったのか、"
f2017023,"00:00:43.05","00:00:48.12","1","あのーある日、昆布じゃないや、あのーワカメをいっぱい買ってきたらしいんですね。"
f2017023,"00:00:48.49","00:00:54.52","1","で、ワカメを棚に入れといて、で、まだ誕生日までは日があるから、"
f2017023,"00:00:54.54","00:00:58.44","1","ちょっと何か食べようかなと思ったんですけど、もう家に何もなくて、"
f2017023,"00:00:58.47","00:01:04.24","1","米、生の米と、こん、ほんとワカメしかないぐらい、すごい貧しい環境だったらしいんですね。"
f2017023,"00:01:04.48","00:01:06.09","1","で、この状況で、"
f2017023,"00:01:06.12","00:01:11.40","1","どうしよう、何か食べないとお腹が空いてねれ、寝られないっていうぐらいお腹が空いちゃって、"
f2017023,"00:01:11.56","00:01:13.10","1","すごく悩んだんですけど、"
f2017023,"00:01:13.36","00:01:18.10","1","ほら、あのー昆布とかって結構そのまま食べてもおいしいじゃないですか。"
f2017023,"00:01:18.13","00:01:23.73","1","あの、韓国だと砂糖とか塩とか振って、まーちょっと炒めてから食べたりするんですけど、"
f2017023,"00:01:24.17","00:01:28.87","1","そんな感じで、ワカメを食べたら結構おいしいのでは？ていうふうに彼は思ったらしいんですよ。"
f2017023,"00:01:29.14","00:01:35.71","1","で、あのーワカメの袋を開けて、ま、お腹がいっぱいになるまで食べてもいいかなって。"
f2017023,"00:01:35.87","00:01:38.26","1","まーなぜかって言うと、ワカメってすごく安いじゃないですか。"
f2017023,"00:01:38.49","00:01:44.09","1","で、ワカメをそのまま、なんかもう固いけど、そのまま食べたらしいんですよ。"
f2017023,"00:01:44.40","00:01:51.12","1","で、ばーってばーって食べて、あーある程度お腹いっぱいになったっていう、ま安心感があって、"
f2017023,"00:01:51.14","00:01:54.61","1","そのままソファーに横になって、眠むっちゃったらしいですね。"
f2017023,"00:01:55.57","00:01:59.89","1","で、しばらくすると何かすごい違和感がしたらしいんですね。"
f2017023,"00:02:00.25","00:02:06.03","1","たぶん、彼はすごい、何でしょう、たぶんあまり経験が長くなかったのかなって思うんですけど。"
f2017023,"00:02:06.10","00:02:11.78","1","たぶん、料理ができる人だったら、何が、何がだめだったのかすぐ分かると思います。"
f2017023,"00:02:11.94","00:02:12.63","1","何か分かる？"
f2017023,"00:02:12.63","00:02:13.60","1","（笑）"
f2017023,"00:02:13.24","00:02:14.55","2","でもワカメはそのままで。"
f2017023,"00:02:13.74","00:02:14.98","3","乾燥のまま。"
f2017023,"00:02:14.79","00:02:19.18","1","そう、ワカメを、乾燥したワカメをそのまま食べてしまったじゃないですか。"
f2017023,"00:02:19.39","00:02:21.72","1","で、かなりの量を食べたんですよ。"
f2017023,"00:02:22.01","00:02:30.25","1","で目が覚めたら何か、お腹の調子が変だな、何かぬめぬめするな、あれ、あれ、のどもなんかってなって、"
f2017023,"00:02:30.62","00:02:36.64","1","目を開けて見たら、もうこの辺、部屋のあちらこちらにもうワカメが、だばーってなってて、"
f2017023,"00:02:36.93","00:02:42.90","1","寝てる時に口を開けたまま寝ちゃったから、そのままあのーふやけたワカメが、"
f2017023,"00:02:43.16","00:02:48.06","1","もうそのまま、なんか吐いたわけじゃないですけど、滝みたいに出てたらしいんですよ。"
f2017023,"00:02:48.07","00:02:49.57","2","（笑）"
f2017023,"00:02:48.40","00:02:49.45","3","ええーっ。"
f2017023,"00:02:49.74","00:02:55.54","1","で、もう息が出来なくて、鼻水だらだらで、「あ、僕これ、どうしよう、やばい。」ってなって、"
f2017023,"00:02:56.09","00:02:58.24","1","そのまま救急車を呼んだらしいんですね。"
f2017023,"00:02:58.38","00:03:01.12","1","で、救急車呼ぶために電話をして、"
f2017023,"00:03:01.17","00:03:06.61","1","「はい、こちら救急車の病院です、どうされましたか？」て聞かれた時に、"
f2017023,"00:03:06.81","00:03:12.05","1","「あのー、ワカメを食べたんですけど、今ワカメをすごく吐いてて、"
f2017023,"00:03:11.28","00:03:14.25","2","（笑）"
f2017023,"00:03:12.62","00:03:15.35","1","助けてください。」って彼は言った、言ったらしいですよ。"
f2017023,"00:03:15.35","00:03:17.98","1","で、救急隊員さんもすごく焦って"
f2017023,"00:03:18.04","00:03:21.74","1","「え、え、何て言ってるんですか、ちょっと、ちょっとよ、よく分からないですけど、"
f2017023,"00:03:21.82","00:03:26.33","1","どういう状況ですか？」って話になって、「とりあえず来てください。」と。"
f2017023,"00:03:26.73","00:03:32.03","1","で、ま、扉を開けて入ってきて、そのワカメがだばだばてなってるの見て、"
f2017023,"00:03:32.54","00:03:36.71","1","その救急隊員さんが「どれぐらいの量を食べたんですか？」って聞いたんですね。"
f2017023,"00:03:36.96","00:03:41.42","1","で、その時に、あのー、ま、吐きながらその袋を確認してみると、"
f2017023,"00:03:42.01","00:03:44.38","1","１袋に２０人前って書いてあるんですね。"
f2017023,"00:03:44.48","00:03:45.50","2","（笑）"
f2017023,"00:03:44.86","00:03:47.23","1","で、それの半分ぐらいを食べて、"
f2017023,"00:03:47.25","00:03:53.24","1","だから１０人前ぐらいのワカメがここからここまで入ってて、そのまま病院に運ばれたらしいですね。"
f2017023,"00:03:53.31","00:04:00.67","1","で、もちろん病院に行ってから胃腸のお掃除とかを、ま、やって、まー調子は治ったらしいですけど、"
f2017023,"00:04:00.84","00:04:05.47","1","それから、あのー、やっぱりお救急車に乗ったからには親に電話がいくじゃないですか。"
f2017023,"00:04:05.78","00:04:07.72","1","その親さんが電話をして、"
f2017023,"00:04:08.02","00:04:13.53","1","そこまで貧しいんだったらちゃんと話せばよかったじゃないのって、すごく言ったらしくって、"
f2017023,"00:04:13.55","00:04:17.41","1","ま、幸い彼はそれで、あの、親の援助を受けて、"
f2017023,"00:04:17.52","00:04:20.47","1","それからはちゃんとしたごはん食べるようになったらしいです。"
f2017023,"00:04:20.83","00:04:21.65","1","おしまいです。"
f2017023,"00:04:21.72","00:04:22.74","2","（笑）"
2017024,"00:00:03.60","00:00:12.35","1","えっと、じゃあ私が、大学受験で、日本史受験を諦めて世界史受験にした話をします。"

2017024,"00:00:24.63","00:00:30.81","1","で、こー３年になったら、受験に向けて好きな方を選べるっていうシステムになってて、"
2017024,"00:00:32.00","00:00:36.13","1","で、ま、も、大抵の人は、その１年生の時に"
2017024,"00:00:36.18","00:00:41.81","1","「わあ、世界史よくできた、こっから世界史頑張ろう。」ってなるはずもなく。"

f2017044,"00:00:32.96","00:00:36.42","1","徐々にごくきれいな絵が出てきました。"
f2017044,"00:00:37.33","00:00:42.30","1","でも、絵をきれいに、えー描くには、長い時間がかかります。"
f2017044,"00:00:42.97","00:00:46.83","1","だから、授業の終わりに間に合い、合いませんでした。"
f2017044,"00:00:47.22","00:00:54.75","1","そしたら、先生は「まだ終わらない人は家で仕上げてください。」と言ったのでほっとしました。"

f2017044,"00:01:14.43","00:01:22.53","1","そしたら先生は、うーん、「素晴らしいけど、いい成績をあげることができません。」と続けました。"

f2017045,"00:00:46.59","00:00:52.68","1","「いいえ、これは全部大人の男性のためのものです。」と答えました。"
f2017045,"00:00:53.45","00:00:57.67","1","「え、風邪薬に男性用なんてあるんですか？」"
f2017045,"00:00:59.98","00:01:02.73","1","「もちろんですよ、これはみんな男性のためです。」"

f2017045,"00:01:22.68","00:01:30.49","1","「あ、そうですか。あのコールドレックスをお願いします。」と私はもう一度頼みました。"

f2017046,"00:00:07.57","00:00:15.05","1","犬や猫等を飼うのは両親が納得しませんでしたが、もっとちさいペットもだめでした。"
f2017046,"00:00:15.90","00:00:23.38","1","ところが、子供は何かを禁止されても言うことを、うー、聞かないのは当たり前のことです。"
f2017046,"00:00:23.93","00:00:26.81","1","こんなに自分のストーリーを始めます。"
f2017046,"00:00:27.67","00:00:34.49","1","数年前に家族と一緒に田舎に住んでいるおじいちゃんを訪ねていきました。"
f2017046,"00:00:34.98","00:00:42.68","1","それは田舎らしい田舎でしたから、羊や牛を育てて犬もいる場所でした。"

f2017046,"00:00:44.15","00:00:49.87","1","動物が大好きな子供に、としては夢のような場所でした。"
f2017046,"00:00:51.99","00:01:03.92","1","その時に動物と一日中遊んだ私は、うーん、ペットを飼いたいという気持ちがもっと強くなりました。"
f2017046,"00:01:05.04","00:01:14.77","1","うーん、だから田舎からペットを、えー、密かに家に持って帰ろうといたずらをすることにしました。"
f2017046,"00:01:15.81","00:01:23.20","1","しかし、羊や牛や、うー、犬は目立ちすぎるから、だめだとわかりました。"
f2017046,"00:01:24.22","00:01:29.57","1","もっとちさいペットを探していて、結局見つけました。"
f2017046,"00:01:31.28","00:01:35.95","1","えー、手の中に入る小さくてかわいいカエルでした。"
f2017046,"00:01:37.21","00:01:46.74","1","え、カエルを手に持っていて幸せな私は、何も知らない、うー、家族を、と、うー家に帰りました。"

f2017046,"00:02:06.78","00:02:11.86","1","残念なことにカエルは排水溝に入ってしまいました。"
f2017046,"00:02:12.83","00:02:21.69","1","こうして、うー、自分のペットを１０分だ、１０分間だけ飼ったストーリーと、が終わります。"

f2017047,"00:00:23.52","00:00:26.89","1","それから３０分ぐらい待たなければならないので、"

f2017047,"00:00:46.58","00:00:49.40","1","少し散歩して、また家に向かいました。"
f2017047,"00:00:50.30","00:00:56.32","1","家の階段を上っていた時、急にどおーんとおっきい音がし、聞こえました。"
f2017047,"00:00:57.24","00:01:03.84","1","走って家に入ったとたん、起きたばかりみたいな父がキッチンの前に立っていました。"

2019001,"00:00:37.0","00:00:39.5","1","で、あたし、高校のころ、"
2019001,"00:00:39.5","00:00:43.7","1","すごい、FPSっていう、まあなんだろう、"
2019001,"00:00:43.7","00:00:47.5","1","銃で、バンバン撃って、対戦する、"
2019001,"00:00:47.5","00:00:50.0","1","オンラインゲームにはまってたんですけど。"
2019001,"00:00:50.0","00:00:51.4","1","あはははは。"
2019001,"00:00:51.4","00:00:53.7","1","すごい、ドはまりしてたんですよ。"
2019001,"00:00:53.7","00:00:57.6","1","で、高校2年のある日、"
2019001,"00:00:57.6","00:01:01.2","1","あー、日曜日か土曜日のころに、"
2019001,"00:01:01.2","00:01:05.2","1","本当に、昼から、午前3時、3時半まで、"
2019001,"00:01:05.2","00:01:09.4","1","ぶっ続けで、やってた時があって、"
2019001,"00:01:09.4","00:01:14.6","1","はい、まあ、本当に楽しく、楽しいとやっちゃうじゃないですかやっぱり。へへ。"
2019001,"00:01:14.6","00:01:17.9","1","で、やってて、さすがに、"
2019001,"00:01:17.9","00:01:21.2","1","時計見て、午前3時ってことに気づいて、"
2019001,"00:01:21.2","00:01:24.3","1","「あ、そろそろやめないとまずいなあ」って思って、"
2019001,"00:01:24.3","00:01:27.6","1","やめて、ベッドに入ったんですよ。電気も消して。"
2019001,"00:01:27.6","00:01:30.1","1","で、ふっ、て目を閉じたら、"
2019001,"00:01:30.1","00:01:35.8","1","何か、すごい、現実としか思えないような光景が、"
2019001,"00:01:35.8","00:01:37.9","1","脳裏にす、よぎったんですよ。"
2019001,"00:01:37.9","00:01:40.5","1","で、その光景の内容っていうのが、"
2019001,"00:01:40.5","00:01:44.1","1","私の視点でもう、銃を、持ってて、"
2019001,"00:01:44.1","00:01:47.5","1","走り回って、戦ってるんですよね。"
2019001,"00:01:47.5","00:01:51.5","1","普通に、ちょっとリアル、リアルっぽい表現をすると、"
2019001,"00:01:51.5","00:01:56.5","1","本当に、あたし結構スナイパー役にはまってたんですけど、"
2019001,"00:01:56.5","00:01:58.3","1","まあ、遠くの敵を、"
2019001,"00:01:58.3","00:02:00.6","1","脳天にバーンって撃ち込むような、"
2019001,"00:02:00.6","00:02:06.4","1","そういう光景が、本当に現実のように、よぎったんですよ。"
2019001,"00:02:06.4","00:02:10.1","1","で、あたしは、その時、ああ、"
2019001,"00:02:10.1","00:02:12.0","1","フラッシュバックは、ちょっと、"
2019001,"00:02:12.0","00:02:14.4","1","心的障害っていう意味があるんで違うんですけど、"
2019001,"00:02:14.4","00:02:19.1","1","そういう、光景を実感してしまいまして、"
2019001,"00:02:19.1","00:02:21.5","1","さすがにちょっと、まあ、"
2019001,"00:02:21.5","00:02:26.7","1","「あ、これ、私、やばいな。」って思って。"
2019001,"00:02:26.7","00:02:29.5","1","ま、その日はそのまま寝たんですけど、"
2019001,"00:02:29.5","00:02:33.8","1","まあその光景っていうのは、今でも忘れられなくて。"
2019001,"00:02:33.8","00:02:37.9","1","ああ正直言って、まあ昨日その話を思い出して、"
2019001,"00:02:37.9","00:02:39.9","1","話？経験を思い出して、"
2019001,"00:02:39.9","00:02:43.7","1","まあ、いまだにちょっと、ほほほ、"
2019001,"00:02:43.7","00:02:46.4","1","今起きたことのように思い出せるんですけど。"
2019001,"00:02:46.4","00:02:48.9","1","締めがわからない。"
2019001,"00:02:48.9","00:02:53.1","1","まあ、皆さんも、あまり、好きなものと言っても、"
2019001,"00:02:53.1","00:02:57.3","1","はまりすぎたら、健康と、心には、悪いよ。"
2019001,"00:02:57.3","00:02:58.8","1","ってことを、言っておきます。"
2019001,"00:02:58.8","00:03:00.2","1","以上でーす。"
2019002,"00:00:00.1","00:00:02.9","1","私も、面白い話って聞くと、"
2019002,"00:00:02.9","00:00:06.5","1","すごい、楽しい話をしよっかなあって思ったんですけど、"
2019002,"00:00:06.5","00:00:09.3","1","そんな、そういう話って意外とこう、"
2019002,"00:00:09.3","00:00:12.4","1","一部の人に、しか刺さらないとかっていうのが多いので、"
2019002,"00:00:12.4","00:00:14.1","1","ちょっと、「おお。」みたいな話を"
2019002,"00:00:14.1","00:00:15.9","1","したいかなあって思います。"
2019002,"00:00:15.9","00:00:21.0","1","で私、世の中って、二種類の人間がいると思うんですよ。"
2019002,"00:00:21.0","00:00:23.5","1","一番目は、初対面でも、"
2019002,"00:00:23.5","00:00:26.5","1","「あっ凄いなこの人は。ちょっと怖いな。」っていう人。"
2019002,"00:00:26.5","00:00:29.0","1","で、二種類目、後者が、"
2019002,"00:00:29.0","00:00:33.2","1","「なんかこの人は別に、何言っても、初対面でも全然平気だし。」"
2019002,"00:00:33.2","00:00:35.2","1","みたいな人が、いると思うんですね。"
2019002,"00:00:35.2","00:00:38.4","1","で、圧倒的に私は後者なんですよ。"
2019002,"00:00:38.4","00:00:41.1","1","初対面の人とかにも全然あの、"
2019002,"00:00:41.1","00:00:42.5","1","敬語使ってもらえないし、"
2019002,"00:00:42.5","00:00:44.9","1","この前のゼミのお話でもしたんですけど、"
2019002,"00:00:44.9","00:00:48.7","1","まず、お店の店員さんに敬語を使ってもらえないんですよ。"
2019002,"00:00:48.7","00:00:51.8","1","で、しかもこの大学に入ってからコンビニで"
2019002,"00:00:51.8","00:00:54.2","1","15回以上列抜かされてるんですよ。"
2019002,"00:00:54.2","00:00:55.7","1","つらいんですよ。"
2019002,"00:00:55.7","00:00:59.4","1","で、しかも例えば、中学生のころなんかは、"
2019002,"00:00:59.4","00:01:01.2","1","知らない近所の男の子に、"
2019002,"00:01:01.2","00:01:02.8","1","「やーい、ブサイク。」とかいって"
2019002,"00:01:02.8","00:01:05.2","1","通りで言われたりとかして。"
2019002,"00:01:05.2","00:01:09.1","1","いや本当に、当時はつらくって、"
2019002,"00:01:09.1","00:01:11.4","1","色んな人に、ほら今だって"
2019002,"00:01:11.4","00:01:13.7","1","私が話してるのに、めっちゃ喋ってるし。"
2019002,"00:01:13.7","00:01:16.4","1","多分これ私がいかついマッチョとかだったらやらないでしょ。"
2019002,"00:01:16.4","00:01:18.3","1","そういうこと、そういうこと。"
2019002,"00:01:18.3","00:01:21.5","1","で、それですごい悩んでて、"
2019002,"00:01:21.5","00:01:24.6","1","あのー、当時は、"
2019002,"00:01:24.6","00:01:27.6","1","やっぱコンプレックスみたいになってて。"
2019002,"00:01:27.6","00:01:29.1","1","で、なんでかなって色々考えて"
2019002,"00:01:29.1","00:01:32.3","1","例えば、すごい酷いなで肩だからいけないのかな、とか"
2019002,"00:01:32.3","00:01:34.6","1","姿勢が悪いからいけないのかなとか、あとは"
2019002,"00:01:34.6","00:01:36.4","1","目つきが悪いからいけないのかな、とか。"
2019002,"00:01:36.4","00:01:38.9","1","で、いろいろ思ってて、"
2019002,"00:01:38.9","00:01:42.9","1","それで友達とか学校の先生に相談してたんですよ。"
2019002,"00:01:43.6","00:01:46.8","1","なんか、そうするとやっぱり返ってくる返事っていうのは"
2019002,"00:01:46.8","00:01:49.3","1","「そんなもん気にしなくていいよ。」とかって言ったりとか、"
2019002,"00:01:49.3","00:01:52.4","1","「言い返してやれよ。」とかって、言われたんですけど。"
2019002,"00:01:52.4","00:01:54.7","1","なーんか、納得できないんですよ。"
2019002,"00:01:54.7","00:01:57.1","1","それって結局その場しのぎに、で、"
2019002,"00:01:57.1","00:01:59.2","1","あんまり解決になっていないっていうか。"
2019002,"00:01:59.2","00:02:01.5","1","それで、最終的に、"
2019002,"00:02:01.5","00:02:03.6","1","あのー、自分の母親に、"
2019002,"00:02:03.6","00:02:06.9","1","「どうすればいいんだろう。」って相談して。"
2019002,"00:02:07.7","00:02:10.1","1","で返ってきた答えが、まず、"
2019002,"00:02:10.1","00:02:11.6","1","「あ、よかったー。」って言われて。"
2019002,"00:02:11.6","00:02:13.0","1","「え、何がよかったの？」って。"
2019002,"00:02:13.0","00:02:14.7","1","「ひどいじゃん。」って言ったら、"
2019002,"00:02:14.7","00:02:18.0","1","「いや、自分のね、育てた子供が、"
2019002,"00:02:18.0","00:02:19.5","1","その、人とか、"
2019002,"00:02:19.5","00:02:22.7","1","例えばぱっと見、ちょっと弱そうに見える人に対して、"
2019002,"00:02:22.7","00:02:26.3","1","踏みつけたりするような側じゃなくて本当によかった。」って。"
2019002,"00:02:26.7","00:02:30.6","1","「傷ついた人じゃないと、なんか、気持ちはわからないから。」って。"
2019002,"00:02:30.6","00:02:34.2","1","「人間は傷つかないと、ひとの気持ちはわからないからね。」って。"
2019002,"00:02:34.2","00:02:37.9","1","「私、自分の子供が、なんか賞を取ったりとか、"
2019002,"00:02:37.9","00:02:41.9","1","かけっこで一位になったとか、そういう話よりも一番、"
2019002,"00:02:41.9","00:02:45.9","1","あんたが優しくって、ひとに気を遣える、子で育って、"
2019002,"00:02:45.9","00:02:48.1","1","今が一番うれしい。」って言ってもらって。"
2019002,"00:02:48.1","00:02:53.0","1","それからすごいあの、「あっ。すごいな。この人は。」って。"
2019002,"00:02:53.0","00:02:55.0","1","ってか、言葉ってすごいなって思って、"
2019002,"00:02:55.8","00:02:58.3","1","だから、もし、私とおんなじ悩み、"
2019002,"00:02:58.3","00:02:59.2","1","多分いないと思うんですけど、"
2019002,"00:02:59.2","00:03:02.4","1","おんなじ悩みで悩んでる人は、それでいいんだよ。ってことで、"
2019002,"00:03:02.5","00:03:05.2","1","あとは、一回でもそういうことをやったことがある人は、"
2019002,"00:03:05.2","00:03:08.3","1","まあ、自分のことを、ちょっと、"
2019002,"00:03:08.7","00:03:12.6","1","客観的に見てみてくださいという話で、おしまいです。"
2019002,"00:03:13.1","00:03:14.1","1","ありがとうございました。"
2019003,"00:00:00.0","00:00:02.7","1","えーっと、じゃあ、自分は、"
2019003,"00:00:02.7","00:00:07.3","1","まあ最近母親に聞いた、話をちょっと、"
2019003,"00:00:07.3","00:00:10.2","1","面白いってほどじゃなかったんですけど、"
2019003,"00:00:10.2","00:00:14.4","1","まああったんで、ちょっと話す、そうと思います。"
2019003,"00:00:14.4","00:00:20.1","1","えっと、自分、小学生の時に、そのー、"
2019003,"00:00:20.1","00:00:23.3","1","はん、歯のかみ合わせが悪くて、"
2019003,"00:00:23.3","00:00:26.9","1","よく、歯医者に行かなきゃいけなかったんですよ。"
2019003,"00:00:26.9","00:00:30.5","1","で、特に大した事やらないんですけど、"
2019003,"00:00:30.5","00:00:33.4","1","無性に怖くって、"
2019003,"00:00:33.4","00:00:36.7","1","な、なぜ、まあ全然本当にやること、"
2019003,"00:00:36.7","00:00:40.7","1","歯磨いて、ただちょっとかみ合わせを調整してって"
2019003,"00:00:40.7","00:00:42.9","1","それぐらいしかやってなかったんですけど、"
2019003,"00:00:42.9","00:00:46.7","1","それだけでなん、なんか行くのすっごい怖かったんですよ。"
2019003,"00:00:46.7","00:00:50.7","1","あのー、なん、理由は全然わかってなかったんですけど。"
2019003,"00:00:50.7","00:00:54.2","1","で、さい、それで最近、親が、"
2019003,"00:00:54.9","00:00:58.4","1","「お前、あのー、歯医者、すっごい嫌いだったけど、"
2019003,"00:00:58.4","00:01:01.6","1","それ私のせいなんだよ。」って、急に言い始めて。"
2019003,"00:01:01.6","00:01:09.5","1","で、そのー、昔、あの、本当に二歳とかの話なんですけど、"
2019003,"00:01:09.5","00:01:12.4","1","あのー、自分初めて虫歯になりまして、"
2019003,"00:01:12.4","00:01:14.7","1","「じゃあ歯医者行こう。」ってなったんですよ。"
2019003,"00:01:14.7","00:01:18.3","1","で、歯医者に行ったんですけど、"
2019003,"00:01:18.3","00:01:21.6","1","そこが、す、ちょっと、"
2019003,"00:01:21.6","00:01:23.7","1","まあちょっとやばいところでして。"
2019003,"00:01:23.7","00:01:29.8","1","あのー、お、二歳の子供を、両手両足掴んで、"
2019003,"00:01:29.8","00:01:33.3","1","あの、顔をこう、三人がかりで固定して、"
2019003,"00:01:33.3","00:01:35.6","1","で、ドリルで削るような、そういう、"
2019003,"00:01:35.6","00:01:38.2","1","そういう怖いところだったんですよ。"
2019003,"00:01:38.2","00:01:42.8","1","で、で「お母さんもおさえててください。」っていうようなところで、"
2019003,"00:01:42.8","00:01:47.7","1","あのー、「自分は、あのー息子の虫歯を治すために、"
2019003,"00:01:47.7","00:01:51.7","1","拷問に行かせたような気持ちだった。」とかいう話をされて。"
2019003,"00:01:51.7","00:01:56.0","1","で、しかも、それが、一回だけじゃなくて、"
2019003,"00:01:56.0","00:01:58.4","1","その虫歯一個のために、一か月間はい、"
2019003,"00:01:58.4","00:02:00.5","1","あのー通ったみたいで。"
2019003,"00:02:00.5","00:02:04.0","1","で、あのー、"

2019003,"00:02:05.0","00:02:06.8","1","う、うまく行か、ないかも知んないですけど。"
2019003,"00:02:06.8","00:02:11.5","1","あのー、それで、まあ、"
2019003,"00:02:11.5","00:02:14.1","1","一週間は耐えたらしいんですよ、自分。"
2019003,"00:02:14.1","00:02:19.4","1","あの、泣き叫びながら、毎日毎日頑張って行ったみたいなんですよ。"
2019003,"00:02:19.4","00:02:24.2","1","ただ、三週間ぐらいで目が死にはじまし、は、死に始めたみたいで、"
2019003,"00:02:24.2","00:02:29.0","1","ちょっと、あの、悲鳴も上げなくなりまして、"
2019003,"00:02:29.0","00:02:31.2","1","あ、本当に、奴隷、あ、"
2019003,"00:02:31.2","00:02:34.6","1","なんか拷問されたあとの奴隷みたいな状況になり始めまして。"
2019003,"00:02:34.6","00:02:36.7","1","「こりゃあ本当にやばい。」って、"
2019003,"00:02:36.7","00:02:41.3","1","あの流石に、あのー歯医者がおかしいってことに気づいたお母さんが、"
2019003,"00:02:41.3","00:02:44.5","1","ちょっと周りに、話を聞いてみたんですよ。"
2019003,"00:02:44.5","00:02:48.1","1","そしたら、そこの歯医者は本当にひどくて、"
2019003,"00:02:48.1","00:02:51.8","1","あのー、ちょっと、あの、やばいから、"
2019003,"00:02:51.8","00:02:56.2","1","あのー他のところ行ったほうがいいよって話を、されたんですけど。"

2019003,"00:03:00.2","00:03:01.8","1","で、あと一週間だから、"
2019003,"00:03:01.8","00:03:04.5","1","「まあ一週間だからいっか。」って、"
2019003,"00:03:05.6","00:03:10.1","1","言って、最後の方も通い、通ったんですね。"
2019003,"00:03:10.6","00:03:12.9","1","で、自分、目死んでたんですけど、"
2019003,"00:03:12.9","00:03:15.6","1","あのー、最後のほうが、"
2019003,"00:03:15.6","00:03:18.6","1","さらにおっきなドリル使い始めちゃって、"
2019003,"00:03:18.6","00:03:21.2","1","で、それが、ガチで怖かったのか、"
2019003,"00:03:21.2","00:03:23.8","1","また泣き始めたんですけど。"
2019003,"00:03:23.8","00:03:26.9","1","あのー、それで、んー、また無理やり、"

2019005,"00:00:36.0","00:00:38.1","1","私たちの分の席まで無いわけです。"
2019005,"00:00:38.4","00:00:40.4","1","ということで雨が降ってしまった日は、"

2019005,"00:01:28.6","00:01:31.6","1","で、そこに本来、もともとそこにお世話になってた3人は、"
2019005,"00:01:31.6","00:01:33.4","1","すごい楽しそうにやってるんですけど。"

f2019017,"00:04:23.5","00:04:32.8","1","それまでも出てこなかった全身の力を使って、その男を教室の外まで押し出しました。"
f2019017,"00:04:32.8","00:04:39.9","1","そのあとは、ま、先生が不思議な顔をしながら、教室を出ました。"
f2019017,"00:04:39.9","00:04:47.8","1","Aさんは、自習時間が終わる瞬間、逃げようとした様子で、走っていきました。"
f2019017,"00:04:47.8","00:04:53.9","1","そのあと、何か起こったのは、よくわからないんですが、"

f2019046,"00:00:07.0","00:00:11.5","1","日本の電車の中に、驚くほど、脱毛の広告が多いです。"
f2019046,"00:00:12.3","00:00:15.2","1","んー、以前日本で観光旅行していた時も、"
f2019046,"00:00:15.3","00:00:18.6","1","今、交流学生として通学している日々も、"
f2019046,"00:00:18.7","00:00:22.8","1","電車に乗るとき、必ず目に入るのは、脱毛の広告です。"
f2019046,"00:00:23.2","00:00:27.1","1","ときどき、男性向けの脱毛広告も見かけますが、"
f2019046,"00:00:27.1","00:00:31.1","1","一番よく見かけるのは女性、向けの脱毛広告です。"
f2019046,"00:00:31.7","00:00:34.5","1","「全身6回で、99000円」や、"
f2019046,"00:00:34.5","00:00:37.3","1","「全身2回で、50000円」のプログラムや、"

f2019046,"00:00:40.3","00:00:42.6","1","様々な内容と値段があります。"

f2019046,"00:00:46.7","00:00:50.6","1","返事は、多分、「わき毛と、Vラインでもう十分だから、"
f2019046,"00:00:50.6","00:00:53.2","1","どうして、全身脱毛するの？」でしょう。"
f2019046,"00:00:53.4","00:00:56.3","1","さらに、「指の毛、剃ってないね。」と言ったら、"
f2019046,"00:00:57.0","00:01:00.1","1","「指の毛？剃る人ほんとにいるのかなあ。"
f2019046,"00:01:00.2","00:01:03.2","1","そこに毛が生えていることさえ忘れそうなのに。」"
f2019046,"00:01:03.3","00:01:04.9","1","という答えが予想できます。"
f2019046,"00:01:05.5","00:01:09.0","1","もちろん指の毛が気になる人もいるかもしれませんが、"
f2019046,"00:01:09.0","00:01:12.7","1","台湾の女性の99%は気にしないと思います。"
f2019046,"00:01:13.3","00:01:16.1","1","こんな、全身脱毛広告が大変少ない"
f2019046,"00:01:16.1","00:01:18.2","1","環境で育てられましたので、"
f2019046,"00:01:18.2","00:01:20.1","1","日本に来て、電車の中で、"
f2019046,"00:01:20.1","00:01:23.1","1","これほどたくさんの脱毛広告を見かけて、"
f2019046,"00:01:23.4","00:01:27.6","1","「この、脱毛に対する執着心は変だなあ。」と思ってしまいます。"
f2019046,"00:01:28.4","00:01:32.5","1","この前、一橋の正規生である、高校時代の友達に、"
f2019046,"00:01:33.0","00:01:35.5","1","「日本人は本当に、指の毛が汚いとか、"
f2019046,"00:01:35.5","00:01:39.5","1","剃るべきだと思ってるの？」と、面白半分に訊きましたが、"
f2019046,"00:01:39.9","00:01:43.4","1","「気にする人結構いるから、剃った方がいいかもしれない。」と、"
f2019046,"00:01:43.5","00:01:45.5","1","真面目にアドバイスしてもらいました。"
f2019046,"00:01:46.1","00:01:50.6","1","日本人からすれば、ええ、台湾の女性は垢ぬけてない、"
f2019046,"00:01:50.6","00:01:52.5","1","と思われるかもしれませんが、"
f2019046,"00:01:52.9","00:01:57.3","1","国ごとに食文化が違うと同じく、美意識も違います。"
f2019046,"00:01:57.8","00:02:01.1","1","私は日本人のそういう清潔感を重視するす、"
f2019046,"00:02:01.5","00:02:03.3","1","価値観を尊敬していますが、"
f2019046,"00:02:03.8","00:02:08.3","1","やはり、台湾の除毛に対する少し気楽な雰囲気が大好きです。"
f2019046,"00:02:08.8","00:02:12.2","1","私にとって、剃る必要があるのはわき毛だけで、"
f2019046,"00:02:12.2","00:02:15.3","1","男性の毛も、女性の毛も、ちゃんと洗っているなら"
f2019046,"00:02:15.3","00:02:18.0","1","別に汚く感じることもありませんし、"
f2019046,"00:02:18.3","00:02:21.7","1","指の毛は黙々と肌を、肌を守る役割を"
f2019046,"00:02:21.7","00:02:24.1","1","果たす、目立たない存在だと思います。"

f2019047,"00:00:00.0","00:00:02.8","1","以前、ちょうど2年前か、"

f2019047,"00:00:20.6","00:00:24.1","1","その、中央の機械室に大きな火災があって、"
f2019047,"00:00:24.3","00:00:27.2","1","もう全員が出動して、まあ、星たち、"

f2019047,"00:00:43.0","00:00:45.5","1","もう、火を消すことに成功して、"
f2019047,"00:00:45.8","00:00:48.1","1","その結果、その結果として、"
f2019047,"00:00:48.6","00:00:50.4","1","もう、ご褒美を貰ったんですけど、"

f2019048,"00:00:00.0","00:00:05.1","1","はい、あの、私は、日本に来て、驚いたのは、"
f2019048,"00:00:05.7","00:00:10.4","1","日本と中国の、キャ、キャッシュレスの、形が、"
f2019048,"00:00:10.5","00:00:11.7","1","違すぎで。"
f2019048,"00:00:12.3","00:00:15.2","1","あのー、もちろん日本もいま、"
f2019048,"00:00:15.7","00:00:19.6","1","あの、キャッシュレスのブームが、どんどん、あの、"
f2019048,"00:00:19.6","00:00:21.8","1","広がっていると思いますけど、"
f2019048,"00:00:22.5","00:00:27.0","1","でも、その形が、ちょっと、中国と、違うんですね。"
f2019048,"00:00:27.3","00:00:33.0","1","中国だと、あの、Alipayと、あの、WeChat Payの、"
f2019048,"00:00:33.8","00:00:37.8","1","二つしかないぐらい、ですね。"
f2019048,"00:00:38.1","00:00:43.5","1","だから、あの、あの、みんな一人ひとりの携帯で"
f2019048,"00:00:43.5","00:00:47.1","1","必ずAlipayとWeChat Payがあるから、"
f2019048,"00:00:47.5","00:00:51.9","1","これで、あの、全部の店で、使えるように、なっているんです。"
f2019048,"00:00:52.4","00:00:57.0","1","ですが、日本は、あのー、あの、キャッシュしか"
f2019048,"00:00:57.0","00:00:59.9","1","できないとこも、もちろんあるし、"
f2019048,"00:01:00.2","00:01:02.0","1","あの、キャッシュレスできても、"
f2019048,"00:01:02.2","00:01:05.0","1","その、キャッシュレスをする、"
f2019048,"00:01:05.5","00:01:08.4","1","例えば、アプリ、が、多すぎて、"
f2019048,"00:01:08.8","00:01:13.2","1","は、LINE、LINE Payもあって、PayPayもあ、あって、"
f2019048,"00:01:13.4","00:01:18.0","1","あー、楽天ペイもあって、あのー、あとなんだろ、"
f2019048,"00:01:18.0","00:01:21.2","1","LINE、え、LINE言ったか。あのー、まあ、"
f2019048,"00:01:21.2","00:01:22.9","1","他、他もあると思います。"
f2019048,"00:01:23.4","00:01:28.2","1","あの、こんな、こんな、こんな多いアプリが、ある、"
f2019048,"00:01:28.2","00:01:33.1","1","あ、あの、ある、から、あの、キャッシュレスの、"
f2019048,"00:01:33.1","00:01:35.1","1","便利性が減っていくんですよ。"
f2019048,"00:01:35.8","00:01:39.9","1","なぜなら、あの、あ、あの、アプリレスになっていないから。"
f2019048,"00:01:40.4","00:01:45.1","1","あの、あの、あのー、たくさんのアプリが、あって、"
f2019048,"00:01:45.1","00:01:49.3","1","どれに使うのか、あのー、この、あの、金額の管理も"
f2019048,"00:01:49.3","00:01:55.6","1","難しくなる、し、あの、あの、キャッシュレスになったけど、"
f2019048,"00:01:55.6","00:01:59.3","1","便利にはなってない、という状況になっていると思います。"
f2019048,"00:02:00.2","00:02:04.2","1","そして、あの、すごく、あの、変だと思ったのは、"
f2019048,"00:02:04.4","00:02:08.9","1","その、PayPayに、ペイ、PayPayとLINE Payもチャージして、"
f2019048,"00:02:08.9","00:02:11.1","1","使う、方法なんですね。"
f2019048,"00:02:11.3","00:02:14.5","1","で、このチャージの、の方法の一つは、"
f2019048,"00:02:14.7","00:02:19.4","1","コンビニで、現金で、チャージする、方法なんですよ。"
f2019048,"00:02:19.7","00:02:23.4","1","じゃあ、あの、現金も持ってチャージするなら、"
f2019048,"00:02:23.4","00:02:27.0","1","直接ちぇ、現金を使えばいいんじゃない？"
f2019048,"00:02:27.3","00:02:28.4","1","となるんですよ。"
f2019048,"00:02:29.2","00:02:33.0","1","で、あの、でも、でも、あのー、"
f2019048,"00:02:33.1","00:02:36.7","1","全部悪いことばかりではないと思いますね。"
f2019048,"00:02:37.2","00:02:38.4","1","あの、なぜかというと、"
f2019048,"00:02:38.7","00:02:41.4","1","あぷ、やっぱり、日本でまだスマートフォンを"
f2019048,"00:02:41.4","00:02:44.3","1","使ってい、いないひともいるから、"
f2019048,"00:02:44.8","00:02:49.2","1","あの、あの、あの、なんか、キャッシュレスの方法を"
f2019048,"00:02:49.2","00:02:51.3","1","信頼していない人もいるから、"
f2019048,"00:02:51.7","00:02:54.9","1","あの、こう、こ、こんな人たちのために、"
f2019048,"00:02:55.1","00:03:00.6","1","現金を使える、という方法を残って、おくのが、"
f2019048,"00:03:01.0","00:03:03.9","1","すごく、やさしい、と思います。"
f2019048,"00:03:04.9","00:03:09.3","1","あの、中国では、まるで反、反対的で、"
f2019048,"00:03:09.4","00:03:13.2","1","あの、例えば、あの、小売りに行ったら、"
f2019048,"00:03:13.2","00:03:16.5","1","あの、「現金、現金でいいですか？」と訊いたら、"
f2019048,"00:03:16.5","00:03:19.7","1","「駄目です。」と言われる場合もあるから、"
f2019048,"00:03:20.1","00:03:25.2","1","それは逆に、あの、迷惑になる可能性もあると思います。"
f2019048,"00:03:25.9","00:03:29.3","1","だから、あの、んー、す、こ、こう、"

f2019055,"00:00:11.8","00:00:15.1","1","もうすごい、なんか違和感、違和感を覚えることは、"
f2019055,"00:00:15.1","00:00:16.9","1","まあ既になくなってるんですけど、"
f2019055,"00:00:17.2","00:00:19.7","1","なんか、いまでも、まあ、日本、ある食文化について、"

f2019055,"00:00:47.6","00:00:49.0","1","思っていたんですけれども、"
f2019055,"00:00:49.0","00:00:52.1","1","まあ、これを見て、本当に、なん、なぜ、"
f2019055,"00:00:52.1","00:00:53.9","1","全部、なんか、その、繊維、なんか、ちょっと、"
f2019055,"00:00:53.9","00:00:56.5","1","野菜の繊維とか、もうちょっと、しょしゅ、しょしゅ、"
f2019055,"00:00:56.5","00:00:58.9","1","なんか摂取したいなと、思うときに、"
f2019055,"00:00:58.9","00:01:01.2","1","まあ、キャベツの、ものが、"
f2019055,"00:01:01.2","00:01:04.1","1","キャベツの、そすし、しかもなんか、加熱してない、"

f2019055,"00:01:08.0","00:01:10.9","1","まあ全体的には、なー、ご飯の全体的には、"
f2019055,"00:01:11.2","00:01:14.2","1","炒飯と、餃子、つまり、まあ、"
f2019055,"00:01:14.2","00:01:16.6","1","一気に二食を摂った感じもしますね。"
f2019055,"00:01:16.6","00:01:19.0","1","なんか、中華圏の人にとって、やっぱり、"
f2019055,"00:01:19.1","00:01:23.2","1","餃子は、主食扱いで、えっと、なんか、"
f2019055,"00:01:23.2","00:01:26.2","1","餃子を食べると、まあ、大体は軽く、和え物とか、"
f2019055,"00:01:26.2","00:01:28.4","1","その、まあ、スープを飲んだりして、"

f2019055,"00:01:31.7","00:01:34.3","1","そういう習慣が、さすがにないんですね。"
f2019055,"00:01:34.4","00:01:37.0","1","だからやっぱり、のー、まあ、この前私も、なんか、"
f2019055,"00:01:37.0","00:01:41.2","1","静岡の浜松に行って、浜松の名物と言えば、餃子なので、"

f2019055,"00:01:50.5","00:01:53.7","1","なんか、その、食べた食感は、すごい、なんか、"
f2019055,"00:01:53.7","00:01:56.1","1","その、羽根の部分がパリパリしてて、"
f2019055,"00:01:56.2","00:01:59.0","1","なんか、皮の部分がもっちりしたより、もうちょっと、"
f2019055,"00:01:59.1","00:02:02.0","1","なんか、柔らかいイメージ。そして、中のなんか、肉の、"
f2019055,"00:02:02.5","00:02:05.0","1","餡の部分もすごい、なんか柔らかくて、"
f2019055,"00:02:05.2","00:02:07.1","1","なんか、もっちり、すごい、なんか、"
f2019055,"00:02:07.1","00:02:09.2","1","歯ごたえがあるような感じするより"
f2019055,"00:02:09.2","00:02:11.2","1","まあ、もうちょっと、なんか、その、柔らかく、"
f2019055,"00:02:11.2","00:02:13.3","1","おかずのような感じがしますね。"
f2019055,"00:02:13.6","00:02:17.8","1","で、だから、その、まあすぐ満腹感を覚えるような、"
f2019055,"00:02:17.8","00:02:20.0","1","その、料理ではないなあと思っていて、"
f2019055,"00:02:20.2","00:02:24.2","1","まあすごい、まあ、なんか、す、確かに、日本では主食より"
f2019055,"00:02:24.2","00:02:27.8","1","あ、おかず扱い、したほうがいいかもしれません。"
f2019055,"00:02:28.4","00:02:31.9","1","で、そのあとも、まあ、私だけその、そのような"
f2019055,"00:02:31.9","00:02:34.4","1","違和感を覚え、てるだけじゃなくて、"
f2019055,"00:02:34.4","00:02:36.5","1","この前、なんか、その、深夜番組で、"
f2019055,"00:02:36.5","00:02:39.3","1","なんか、ご存じの、じの方もいるかもしれないですけど、"
f2019055,"00:02:39.3","00:02:42.9","1","『月曜から夜ふかし』という、つ、そういう番組で、"
f2019055,"00:02:42.9","00:02:47.1","1","その、個人の、スタッフが個人、最近の個人ニュースについて、"

f2019055,"00:02:52.3","00:02:56.0","1","その、まあその二人も、相当私のような疑問を、"
f2019055,"00:02:56.0","00:02:57.3","1","なんかスタッフに投げました。"
f2019055,"00:02:57.3","00:03:00.5","1","そして、なんか、すのスタッフの反応としては、"
f2019055,"00:03:00.6","00:03:02.2","1","えっと、例えば、小籠包、"
f2019055,"00:03:02.5","00:03:05.1","1","台湾の小籠包もすごく有名なんですけれども、"
f2019055,"00:03:05.5","00:03:08.7","1","まあ小籠包は、同じく、なんかその、炭水化物の、"
f2019055,"00:03:08.7","00:03:11.8","1","まあ、皮と、小麦粉の皮と、その、まあ、"
f2019055,"00:03:11.8","00:03:15.1","1","肉の、豚肉の餡、で、そういう組み合わせで、"
f2019055,"00:03:15.1","00:03:19.3","1","でも、まあ、確かに、鼎泰豊という、まあ小籠包の名店で、"
f2019055,"00:03:19.4","00:03:23.4","1","でも、まあ、多分、炒飯と一緒に食べるイメージあるんですけれども、"
f2019055,"00:03:23.4","00:03:26.3","1","それは、その炒飯は、一人一皿ではなくて、"
f2019055,"00:03:26.3","00:03:28.5","1","皆シェアして食べるん、ですよ。"
f2019055,"00:03:28.8","00:03:32.2","1","だから、まあ、おかずって言っても、多分おかずですけど、"
f2019055,"00:03:32.2","00:03:35.5","1","なんか、この話題を友達と、ちょっと話し合って、"
f2019055,"00:03:36.0","00:03:39.5","1","討論してみました結果、ちょっと、結論が出ました。"
f2019055,"00:03:39.8","00:03:42.3","1","つまり、その、小籠包は実際、なんか、"
f2019055,"00:03:42.3","00:03:44.9","1","その、まあ、そういう名店だけではなくて、"
f2019055,"00:03:44.9","00:03:47.0","1","もうちょっと安いバージョンは、朝食の、"
f2019055,"00:03:47.2","00:03:50.3","1","朝ごはんの、なんか、台湾の朝ごはん屋さんでも、まあ、"
f2019055,"00:03:50.6","00:03:52.3","1","売ってました。で、売ってて、"
f2019055,"00:03:52.3","00:03:53.9","1","なんか、その小籠包の場合は、"
f2019055,"00:03:53.9","00:03:57.0","1","その、まあ、その皮は、えっと、"
f2019055,"00:03:57.2","00:04:00.7","1","まあ、餃子よりもうちょっと、なんか、饅頭に似ている、"
f2019055,"00:04:00.7","00:04:02.0","1","その、皮が厚い。"
f2019055,"00:04:02.0","00:04:07.2","1","なんか、かんすいか、化物の、その割合が高い、方は、主食扱いで、"
f2019055,"00:04:07.3","00:04:11.4","1","炭水化ず、物が、ちょっと、なんかその、まあ、割合が、低いほうは、"
f2019055,"00:04:11.4","00:04:15.2","1","まあ大体、ちょっと、まあ、おかず扱い、そして、"
f2019055,"00:04:15.2","00:04:18.0","1","でー、値段がちょっと高めなイメージがしますね。"
f2019055,"00:04:18.0","00:04:21.4","1","まあ、今度も、も、もしみんなが台湾か、あるいは、中華圏、"
f2019055,"00:04:21.4","00:04:24.5","1","中国とかに観光したときに、まあよかったら、"
f2019055,"00:04:24.5","00:04:27.9","1","まあ、食べてみて、なんかその違いを感じてみてください。"
f2019055,"00:04:27.9","00:04:29.5","1","以上です。ありがとうございます。"

f2019058,"00:00:30.8","00:00:34.3","1","えっと、なんか、最初、日本に来たときは、"

f2019058,"00:00:42.3","00:00:46.3","1","なぜかといいますと、香港では、あの、"
f2019058,"00:00:46.5","00:00:49.8","1","みんな、多分、先に、くる、車を、"
f2019058,"00:00:49.8","00:00:52.4","1","行かせてもらう、という習慣があって、"
f2019058,"00:00:52.8","00:00:55.9","1","それで、でも、日本の運転手さんが、"

f2019058,"00:01:01.1","00:01:05.3","1","先に行かせてもらうことが、すごくびっくりしました。"

f2019058,"00:02:51.9","00:02:54.2","1","違いかなって、思いますね。"
f2019058,"00:02:54.2","00:02:55.7","1","はい、以上です。"
2019059,"00:00:00.0","00:00:03.0","1","本校にあの、日本語教師として勤めているんですけれども、"

2019059,"00:00:27.9","00:00:30.3","1","まあ隣のこの壁ぐらいでこう、ちょっとこう、"
2019059,"00:00:30.3","00:00:33.5","1","壁に寄っかかりながらこう、試験監督としてこうやって見ていたんですね。"
2019059,"00:00:33.8","00:00:38.8","1","で、まあ30分ぐらいなんですけれども、15分ぐらい経った時点で、"

2019059,"00:00:56.0","00:01:01.2","1","で、あれ、なんか変だなと思っていたら、彼女は、私を見る。"
2019059,"00:01:01.9","00:01:06.9","1","二秒見る、そのあとまた下に目を移す。で、また私を見る。"

f2023001,"00:00:00.0","00:00:06.0","1","これは私が小学生6年生の頃の話です"
f2023001,"00:00:06.0","00:00:11.0","1","ある日母と一緒にバイクで買い物に行きました"
f2023001,"00:00:11.0","00:00:13.0","1","たくさんの物を買いました"
f2023001,"00:00:13.0","00:00:18.0","1","そして帰る時母のバイクに乗っていましたが"
f2023001,"00:00:18.0","00:00:20.0","1","どんどん眠くなりました"
f2023001,"00:00:20.0","00:00:24.0","1","うとうとうしている時目の前になんと"
f2023001,"00:00:24.0","00:00:29.0","1","高速道路という文字が目に入ってきました"
f2023001,"00:00:29.0","00:00:34.0","1","そして母がどんどんその方向に進んでいきました"
f2023001,"00:00:34.0","00:00:36.0","1","私は気づいて"
f2023001,"00:00:36.0","00:00:41.2","1","お母さんそこは高速道路だよと言いました"
f2023001,"00:00:41.3","00:00:46.6","1","台湾の高速道路ではバイクは通行できません"
f2023001,"00:00:46.4","00:00:50.4","1","もちろん私たちもバイクに乗っていたので"
f2023001,"00:00:50.3","00:00:53.0","1","入ることはできませんでした"
f2023001,"00:00:53.0","00:00:58.0","1","その後、後ろを注意しながらバイクをバックさせ"
f2023001,"00:00:58.1","00:01:02.0","1","なんとか普通の道路まで戻りました"
f2023001,"00:01:02.0","00:01:06.0","1","幸い、他の車は来ませんでした"
f2023001,"00:01:06.0","00:01:13.1","1","後で母にどうして高速道路に入ろうと、としたか聞きましたが"
f2023001,"00:01:13.2","00:01:19.0","1","母もボーっとしていてよく覚えていないとのことでした"
f2023001,"00:01:19.0","00:01:22.0","1","皆様気をつけてくださいね"
f2023002,"00:00:00.0","00:00:06.5","1","皆さん、台湾の夜市ナイトマーケットご存知ですか?"
f2023002,"00:00:06.5","00:00:15.0","1","夜市には台湾グルメがあふれ、毎晩多くの人でにぎわっています。"
f2023002,"00:00:15.0","00:00:24.0","1","私は小さい頃、父と一緒によく夜市へ行っていました。"
f2023002,"00:00:24.0","00:00:28.0","1","ある日、父と一緒に夜市へ行きました。"
f2023002,"00:00:29.0","00:00:38.0","1","その日、その日はとてもにぎやかで、また子供で背が低い私は、"
f2023002,"00:00:38.0","00:00:48.0","1","夜市の中で父とはぐれないよう手をつないで歩いていました。"
f2023002,"00:00:48.0","00:00:55.0","1","父がちょっとタバコを吸うからと私の手を離しました。"
f2023002,"00:00:55.0","00:01:02.7","1","私は人混みの中で迷子になってはいけないと、"
f2023002,"00:01:02.7","00:01:16.0","1","またすぐに父と手をつな、つなぎ、夜市のな、夜市の出口へと向かっていま、向かってきました。"
f2023002,"00:01:17.0","00:01:26.0","1","出口に着くと、やっと人もバラになり、私は上を見上げました。"
f2023002,"00:01:26.0","00:01:35.0","1","あ、パパじゃない!その顔は父とは、ま、ち、全く違う別のおじさんでした。"
f2023002,"00:01:35.0","00:01:38.0","1","私はびっくりしました。"
f2023002,"00:01:38.0","00:01:54.0","1","なんと私は父と勘違いをし、別の人のー、別の人と手をつなぎ、夜市の中を歩き続けていたのです。"
f2023002,"00:01:54.0","00:02:03.0","1","幸いその人も親切な人で、私が迷子になったと思い、"
f2023002,"00:02:03.0","00:02:12.0","1","手をつないで出口の方に連れてきてくれていたのです。"
f2023002,"00:02:12.0","00:02:22.0","1","その後すぐに父が現れ、そのおじい、そのおじさんに事情を説明しました。"
f2023002,"00:02:22.0","00:02:30.0","1","そして父は私を家に連れて帰りました。"
f2023002,"00:02:30.0","00:02:35.0","1","みなさんも気をつけてくださいね。"
f2023003,"00:00:00.0","00:00:04.0","1","これは私が小学校6年生の時のことです。"
f2023003,"00:00:04.0","00:00:11.0","1","当日、私と友達2人は放課後、準備室で各試験をしようを準備しました。"
f2023003,"00:00:11.0","00:00:18.0","1","休み時間に私たちはその教室にあるコピー機で遊んで、ボタンを聞かずに押しました。"
f2023003,"00:00:18.0","00:00:23.0","1","突然、コピー機が動いて試験用紙が10枚以上も出てきました。"
f2023003,"00:00:23.0","00:00:27.0","1","私たちはどうしたらいいかわからなくなりました。"
f2023003,"00:00:27.0","00:00:32.0","1","試験用紙をそのままにしておくわけにはいきませんでした。"
f2023003,"00:00:32.0","00:00:40.0","1","もし学校が誰も持っていかない試験用紙を見つけて、それが私たちのせいだと気がついたらどうしよう。"
f2023003,"00:00:40.0","00:00:45.0","1","しかし、試験用紙を全部家に持ち帰るのはちょっと変です。"
f2023003,"00:00:45.0","00:00:49.0","1","そして、隣のシュレッダーに気がつきました。"
f2023003,"00:00:49.0","00:00:56.0","1","私たちは以前からシュレッダーがかっこいいと思っていましたが、使う機会がありませんでした。"
f2023003,"00:00:56.0","00:01:05.0","1","だから、真剣に見せかけながら実際にはワクワクして、それらをシュレッダーにかけようかと友人に言いました。"
f2023003,"00:01:05.0","00:01:10.0","1","そして、私たちはシュレッダーの使い方を調べ始めました。"
f2023003,"00:01:10.0","00:01:18.0","1","その時、先生が入ってきて変な私たちを一瞥した後で、試験用紙を持っていきました。"
f2023003,"00:01:18.0","00:01:23.0","1","実は、その試験用紙は先生が印刷したものだったのです。"
f2023003,"00:01:23.0","00:01:27.0","1","本当に試験用紙をまたそこに置いておいてよかった。"
f2023003,"00:01:27.0","00:01:34.0","1","そうでなければ、コピー機を起動するよりも恐ろしい事態が発生していたかもしれません。"
f2023004,"00:00:01.0","00:00:08.0","1","ある日、友人と二人で電車に乗って地元に帰ろうとしたのですが、"
f2023004,"00:00:08.0","00:00:17.0","1","彼女は歩きながらメッセージの返事をしていたので、私が引きずって行きました。"
f2023004,"00:00:17.0","00:00:23.0","1","駅に入って階段を降りたところで、ピピピピピという音が聞こえ、"
f2023004,"00:00:23.0","00:00:28.0","1","もうすぐ電車が発車することがわかったので、"
f2023004,"00:00:28.0","00:00:34.0","1","友人を引きずって走り、何とか電車に乗ることができました。"
f2023004,"00:00:34.0","00:00:39.0","1","ところが、次の駅の名前をよく見てみると、"
f2023004,"00:00:38.9","00:00:47.0","1","えー、私たちが行こうとしていた駅とは全く違う駅名だったので、"
f2023004,"00:00:47.0","00:00:54.0","1","私たちは反対の駅に、えー行っていることが気づきました。"
f2023004,"00:00:53.6","00:00:57.4","1","えー、電車の中で大笑いしました。"
f2023004,"00:00:57.7","00:01:00.0","1","大したことではなさそうですが、"
f2023004,"00:01:00.0","00:01:07.0","1","実は電車を乗り間違えたのはこれで第十一回目でした。"
f2023005,"00:00:01.0","00:00:04.6","1","これは私の高校時代のお話です。"
f2023005,"00:00:04.6","00:00:07.7","1","私はまだ次の授業があったので、"
f2023005,"00:00:07.7","00:00:12.7","1","別の教室に移動している時のことでした。"
f2023005,"00:00:12.7","00:00:15.7","1","途中に銅像があったのですが、"

2023052,"00:00:37.2","00:00:42.3","1","で、それが、最初は始まった頃は公園だけだったんだけど、"
2023052,"00:00:42.4","00:00:49.0","1","なんか、みんな興奮し始めて、何回か回を重ねたら、その公園の周りの、"

2023052,"00:00:53.9","00:01:02.7","1","だから、今度その、ただ単に水風船を当てるっていうよりも、なんか、おっかけっこも始まるわけ。チャリで。"

2023052,"00:01:02.7","00:01:06.1","1","ブワーつって。で、最後、あの、"

2023056,"00:01:07.7","00:01:11.0","1","かなり集中して、あと2分経ったらしまえるのに、"

2023057,"00:00:00.4","00:00:06.0","1","あの、ちょっと学生さんの話をちょっと聞いて、あのその話をしたいと思います。"
2023057,"00:00:06.0","00:00:10.0","1","えーと、なんかあの、男の子で運転免許を取りに行ったらしくて、"
2023057,"00:00:10.0","00:00:14.0","1","えーと、仮免終わって、路上に上がって、で、こう運転してる。"
2023057,"00:00:14.0","00:00:20.2","1","で、隣にその、えと、試験、なんて言うんでしょう、運転の教習の先生ですね、がいて、"
2023057,"00:00:20.2","00:00:24.3","1","「あ、じゃあ次、あの、右折してください」って言われたので、こう、右折したらしいんですね。"
2023057,"00:00:24.3","00:00:28.3","1","そして、そこが一通で、しかも警官がいたらしいんですね。"
2023057,"00:00:29.0","00:00:35.3","1","それで、その人が言うには、あの、まだ免許を取ってないのにー減点された。"
2023057,"00:00:35.3","00:00:37.8","1","（笑）"
2023057,"00:00:37.8","00:00:42.7","1","で、あの、私がちょっとあの、聞いて、「いや、じゃあその、罰金はどうしたんだ」って。"
2023057,"00:00:42.7","00:00:46.0","1","「罰金はさすがに自分は払わなかった。ガンとして。」"
2023057,"00:00:46.0","00:00:47.4","1","で、「学校に払ってもらった。"
2023057,"00:00:47.4","00:00:52.5","1","でもまだ免、免許、路上にも上がって、本当に走ってないのに、もう減点つきました。"
2023057,"00:00:52.5","00:00:54.4","1","ゴールドじゃありません」って言ってました。"
2023057,"00:00:54.4","00:00:56.0","1","はい、以上です。"
2023058,"00:00:00.0","00:00:06.0","1","はい、えっとー、私のちょっと面白い話を、えー、いたします。"
2023058,"00:00:06.0","00:00:10.0","1","えーっと、押してダメなら引いてみろ、という言い方がありますね。"
2023058,"00:00:10.0","00:00:12.1","1","あのー、押してダメなら引いてみろ。"
2023058,"00:00:12.1","00:00:17.0","1","えー、まあ、よく誰かを好きになって、その人に好きだ、好きだ、と。"
2023058,"00:00:17.0","00:00:22.0","1","何度言っても、押して押してね、何度言っても振り向いてくれない。"
2023058,"00:00:22.0","00:00:25.0","1","そういう時には、ちょっと引いてみるんですね。静かに黙る。"
2023058,"00:00:25.0","00:00:28.7","1","すると相手がね、振り、振り向い、振り返って、"
2023058,"00:00:28.7","00:00:32.8","1","いや、「私あなた好きなのよ」っていう可能性がありますよね。"
2023058,"00:00:32.8","00:00:36.5","1","そういう経験皆さんあると思うんですけど、私はないですけどね。"
2023058,"00:00:36.5","00:00:41.8","1","あのー、今日の私の話は、もうちょっと現実的な話で、"
2023058,"00:00:41.8","00:00:47.6","1","あのー、まあ、1万円ぐらい助かったという、えー、話です。"
2023058,"00:00:47.6","00:00:54.9","1","ちょっとこれを見てください。えーっとですね、これは、えー、まあ、スーツケースなんですが、"
2023058,"00:00:54.9","00:00:59.4","1","私はえー、よく、えー、若い時に旅行しまして、"
2023058,"00:00:59.4","00:01:03.1","1","えー、スーツケースを持ってるんですけど、この部分がよく悪くなるんですね。"
2023058,"00:01:03.3","00:01:07.1","1","それで何度ももう自分で、一つだけ悪くなって、替えるのに、"
2023058,"00:01:07.1","00:01:11.4","1","一つだけなら全部替えちゃうってことで、1万円とか1万5000円とかかかってたんですね。"
2023058,"00:01:11.4","00:01:17.4","1","で、今度はもう、そんなにたくさんお金を使うぐらいだったら、新しいの買う方がいいと思って、"
2023058,"00:01:17.4","00:01:21.8","1","むしろ、安いものをちゃんとできるんじゃないかと思って、ネットで調べると、"
2023058,"00:01:21.8","00:01:27.5","1","いや、あのー、500円1000円ぐらいでできるっていうことなので、えー、それを買いました。"
2023058,"00:01:27.5","00:01:32.2","1","で、そのためにはね、この、これが鉄を切るのこぎりなんですけど、"
2023058,"00:01:32.2","00:01:35.7","1","これでまあ、押すわけ。この部分を一生懸命押すんです。"
2023058,"00:01:35.7","00:01:42.5","1","ところが、1時間、こう、頑張ってきばっても、１マ、1ミリ切れるか切れないか、"
2023058,"00:01:42.5","00:01:43.9","1","押して、押してもダメなんです。"
2023058,"00:01:43.9","00:01:48.7","1","で、ちょっと休んで、また1時間ぐらいこうやってもダメ、こちらやってもダメなんですね。"
2023058,"00:01:48.7","00:01:55.0","1","で、何度もそれを試したけどダメなので、まあ、どうしようかと思って、ちょっともう諦めて、"
2023058,"00:01:55.0","00:02:01.0","1","こちらのキャスター交換とか、こういうところでお金を払ってやってもらおうかなと思ったんですけど、"
2023058,"00:02:01.0","00:02:05.4","1","ふと、まあ、別の方法があると思ったんです。"
2023058,"00:02:05.4","00:02:07.6","1","で、それは、これなんですね。"
2023058,"00:02:07.6","00:02:13.0","1","これは、この電気でやるもの。だから、まあ、1時間でもできるわけなんです。"
2023058,"00:02:13.0","00:02:17.0","1","で、これは、ここを押さえるというふうになります。この部分を。"
2023058,"00:02:17.0","00:02:20.0","1","これをグッと押さえるんですね。これを押さえたらこうですね。"
2023058,"00:02:20.0","00:02:22.7","1","で、実はそれでやってみたんです。"
2023058,"00:02:22.7","00:02:27.6","1","ところが、5分押してもうまくいかない。10分押してもうまくいかない。"
2023058,"00:02:27.6","00:02:33.5","1","これが熱くなるので、休んで、もう一度また5分、10分と押してやるんですけど、ダメなんです。"
2023058,"00:02:33.5","00:02:37.1","1","あ、もうダメだと思って、諦めようと思ったんです。"
2023058,"00:02:37.1","00:02:39.8","1","ですから、えー"
2023058,"00:02:39.8","00:02:44.2","1","思ったんですけど、ちょっと考えてね、すると、このレバーがあるんですね。ここにね。"
2023058,"00:02:44.4","00:02:47.0","1","このレバーを押すと、"
2023058,"00:02:47.8","00:02:52.0","1","逆に回るんです。で、これでやっていくと、"
2023058,"00:02:52.0","00:02:56.0","1","逆、押すんですね。押したけど、結果的には引いてる。"
2023058,"00:02:56.0","00:03:00.3","1","で、ものの、まあ、え、15秒、"
2023058,"00:03:00.3","00:03:06.4","1","20秒ぐらいで、きれいにこれが取れて、新しいものをつけることができました。"
2023058,"00:03:06.4","00:03:09.1","1","まあ、そういうわけで、えー"
2023058,"00:03:09.1","00:03:13.3","1","1万円払わなくても1000円ぐらいでできちゃったという話なんですが、"
2023058,"00:03:13.4","00:03:15.4","1","まあ、皆さんもぜひ、"
2023058,"00:03:15.4","00:03:18.9","1","あのー押してダメな時にはね、引いてみるっていうことを"

2023059,"00:01:53.0","00:01:59.0","1","2匹も入ってきたので、もう入ってこないように、絶対ドアを閉めたというね、えー、ことなんです。"
2023059,"00:01:59.0","00:02:06.5","1","まぁ、なんかちょっとまとまってないかな?ツバメが最初1匹入ってきて、ぐるっと回って、"
2023059,"00:02:06.5","00:02:11.6","1","これは良いとこだなと思ったんでしょうね。もう1匹来て、さらに2匹で今度入ってきて、"

2023060,"00:00:09.3","00:00:14.4","1","で、えーっと、私があのー、ドイツに行って、たくましくなった話なんですけど、"
2023060,"00:00:14.6","00:00:20.6","1","もうドイツ人ってのは全部自分でやるので、もう私も一人暮らしだったし、全部一人でやらなきゃいけない。"
2023060,"00:00:20.6","00:00:26.0","1","自転車がパンクしてー、あのー、自転車、自転車屋さんに持って行って直してもらおうと思ったら、"
2023060,"00:00:26.0","00:00:27.6","1","「パンクしたんですけどー」って言ったら"

2023060,"00:00:32.5","00:00:36.3","1","「な、な、なにこれ、いや、パンクしたんです。」「そうでしょ、100円」って。"
2023060,"00:00:36.3","00:00:38.0","1","自分で直せるっていうことです。"
2023060,"00:00:38.0","00:00:43.1","1","そういうことがしょっちゅうあってー、こう、女の子でも電気ドリルをバーッとか使うとか、"
2023060,"00:00:43.2","00:00:49.0","1","なんか女の子用に小さいのもあるらしくて、ガーってやったりとか、大抵みんな自分で直す。"
2023060,"00:00:49.4","00:00:53.1","1","で、あの、私も一応7つ道具を日本から持って行ってですね、"
2023060,"00:00:53.1","00:00:56.5","1","こう金槌とか打てない、金槌打つと大抵指を打つんで、"
2023060,"00:00:56.5","00:01:00.3","1","あのー、でも、ノコギリとかもそういう小さいセットなんか持って行って、"
2023060,"00:01:00.3","00:01:03.0","1","自分で直さなきゃなって思ってたんですが、"
2023060,"00:01:03.0","00:01:08.8","1","えーと、はい、それで、ま、ある時そのノコギリで切るっていう時があって、"
2023060,"00:01:08.8","00:01:12.1","1","それでこう、あの、ドイツ人なんかもう"
2023060,"00:01:12.1","00:01:13.7","1","上手、上手に切るんですね、"

2023060,"00:01:19.4","00:01:23.4","1","一生懸命やるんだけども全然切れない。で、他の子はみな、さっさと切ってると。"
2023060,"00:01:25.5","00:01:33.8","1","で、もうちょっと私だけ切れないので、じゃあ、その押してもダメなら引いてみな。"
2023060,"00:01:33.8","00:01:38.0","1","こう押してるところを引いたら、すぐに切れたっていう。"
2023060,"00:01:38.0","00:01:40.0","2","へぇー。"
2023060,"00:01:40.0","00:01:43.4","1","なぜかというとー、ドイツのノコギリっていうのは、"
2023060,"00:01:43.4","00:01:48.4","1","歯が、え、どうなってんだ、こうな、こうなってて、押す時に切れるんですけど、"
2023060,"00:01:48.4","00:01:54.0","1","日本のノコギリってのは歯がこうなってんですよ。て、ちょっと違う、引いたら切れるっていう。"
2023060,"00:01:54.0","00:01:55.0","1","はい。"
2023060,"00:01:55.0","00:01:57.0","1","勉強になりました。"
2023061,"00:00:00.0","00:00:06.0","1","えっと面白い話にするのはちょっとふきん、不謹慎かもしれないんですけど、ちょっと怖い話でもあります。"
2023061,"00:00:06.0","00:00:10.6","1","えっとー、今、実はちょっと私の母がちょっと体調悪くて、"
2023061,"00:00:10.6","00:00:14.0","1","い、ま、いわゆる介護、みたいなことしてるんですけど、"
2023061,"00:00:14.3","00:00:23.5","1","あのー、まぁちょっと入院していて、あのーもうなんか、今コロナで面会が1日15分とかっていうので、"

2023061,"00:00:26.6","00:00:31.0","1","あのーその付き添いの人に看取りをしたいから荷物を付けて、"
2023061,"00:00:31.0","00:00:37.0","1","それでまぁそれで、あの、付き添いをしてたんですが、で、母が夜、まぁ、看護師さんが聞きますよね、"
2023061,"00:00:37.0","00:00:42.3","1","で、朝、「どうですかよく寝られましたか?」って「いや、寝られないんです」って、大抵よく寝られないと。"
2023061,"00:00:42.3","00:00:47.0","1","で、まぁ夜起きたり、起きて、一緒に、こう確かにお茶を飲んだりしてたんですけども、"
2023061,"00:00:47.8","00:00:49.9","1","ま、夜寝る、夜寝られないっていつも言うので、"
2023061,"00:00:49.9","00:00:53.0","1","じゃあちょっと、あのー、ま睡眠薬ですかね、"
2023061,"00:00:53.0","00:00:56.2","1","あのちょっと薬を飲んでみましょうか、みたいな感じで処方されて、"
2023061,"00:00:56.7","00:00:58.8","1","あのー"
2023061,"00:00:59.3","00:01:01.4","1","ま、それが原因かどうかはわからないんですけど、"
2023061,"00:01:01.4","00:01:05.0","1","その薬を飲んで、飲んだその夜に、"
2023061,"00:01:05.0","00:01:08.6","1","その夜ぐらいからですかね、"
2023061,"00:01:09.2","00:01:10.0","1","あのー"
2023061,"00:01:10.6","00:01:15.8","1","いわゆるせん妄ってご存知ですかね。せん妄っていう現象が母に出たんですよ。"
2023061,"00:01:12.4","00:01:13.3","2","うんうん"
2023061,"00:01:15.3","00:01:15.8","2","うん、"
2023061,"00:01:16.0","00:01:19.5","1","母ってすごいもう、認知症もないし、すごい頭がしっかりしてるんですけどー、"
2023061,"00:01:19.7","00:01:23.0","1","そのー、まぁ何が原因かわからないんだけれども、"
2023061,"00:01:23.0","00:01:27.6","1","まぁ薬剤が原因とあることもあるし、そうじゃないかもしれないんですけど、"
2023061,"00:01:27.6","00:01:31.0","1","本当に、もう、なんかわけのわからないこと言い始めるんですよ。"
2023061,"00:01:31.0","00:01:34.0","1","で、どう、どうしちゃったのお母さん、とか言う感じで、"
2023061,"00:01:34.2","00:01:35.9","1","それで、あのー、"
2023061,"00:01:35.9","00:01:37.5","1","もう"
2023061,"00:01:38.8","00:01:43.9","1","あの幻覚？幻視とか幻聴とか、ほんと幻聴とかがあったり、"
2023061,"00:01:43.9","00:01:45.2","1","幻視があって"
2023061,"00:01:45.2","00:01:48.9","1","で、なんかずーっと夜喋ってるんですよ。なんか読むみたいにして、"
2023061,"00:01:49.0","00:01:51.0","1","なんかが見えてて、わーっとか喋っていたり、"
2023061,"00:01:51.2","00:01:55.0","1","なんかこう見えてて、そのこうして、本当に怖い、怖い夜で、"
2023061,"00:01:55.6","00:01:57.5","1","それで、あのー、"
2023061,"00:01:57.5","00:02:01.2","1","でも夜ずーっと起きてるので、ま、朝なったら疲れて寝るだろうと思ったら、"
2023061,"00:02:01.2","00:02:03.7","1","昼間もずーっとやってるわけですよ。それを。"
2023061,"00:02:04.0","00:02:08.3","1","で、さすがにまぁ、そのー、夜は、と思ったら、その夜もまたずっとこうやってて、"
2023061,"00:02:08.3","00:02:11.0","1","さすがです、ちょっと怖くて、その話を、"
2023061,"00:02:11.0","00:02:14.2","1","こうー、ま、そ、その辺の話はちょっと端折りますけど、"
2023061,"00:02:15.3","00:02:16.4","1","それで、あのー、"
2023061,"00:02:18.0","00:02:19.8","1","いや、きっと睡眠薬が原因なんで、"
2023061,"00:02:19.8","00:02:21.8","1","それで、看護師さんがやっ言ったら、そのー、"
2023061,"00:02:21.8","00:02:25.8","1","幻覚を？治す？薬もあるから、それのみますかって"
2023061,"00:02:25.8","00:02:31.0","1","「いえ、ちょっと、あのー、もうちょっと薬、薬やめてください」って言ったりしてて、"
2023061,"00:02:31.4","00:02:38.4","1","じゃ、その後ーその2日ーぐらい、あの2晩ぐらいもう全然もうただの本当に喋ってて、"
2023061,"00:02:38.3","00:02:44.0","1","もうこれー、力が、体力がなくなってもう事切れるんじゃないかぐらいの勢いで喋ってたんですけど、"
2023061,"00:02:44.0","00:02:49.5","1","そしたら朝、急にぐっすり寝て、全然起きないですよ。"
2023061,"00:02:49.5","00:02:56.1","1","揺らしても喋りかけても、もう昏睡みたいな感じで、ご飯が来るんだけどそのまま返してスキップする感じでー、"
2023061,"00:02:56.3","00:03:00.0","1","話しかけても起きないし、もうこれ目が覚めるんだろうかとか思って、"
2023061,"00:03:00.0","00:03:04.6","1","そっちがまた怖くなって、本当にホラーの3日間だったんですよ。"
2023061,"00:03:05.0","00:03:10.7","1","それでもう、昼間寝るし、ずーっと寝て起きなくて、それでも、まぁ、あのー"
2023061,"00:03:10.7","00:03:11.5","1","目が覚めたときには"
2023061,"00:03:11.5","00:03:14.6","1","やっぱりそばにいないといけないと思ってずっといたんですけど、"
2023061,"00:03:14.6","00:03:17.0","1","2日目、もう、なんかどうも起きそうにもないしー、"
2023061,"00:03:17.0","00:03:20.0","1","だからずっと洗濯とか、あのコインランドリとかあるんですけど、"
2023061,"00:03:20.0","00:03:24.0","1","あの、行けてないので、ちょっと洗濯しなきゃっていうので、ま、寝てるからー、"
2023061,"00:03:24.6","00:03:30.5","1","ちょっとコインランドリに入れてくるぐらいはいいだろうと思って、持って行って、急いで帰ってきた。"
2023061,"00:03:31.0","00:03:35.0","1","で、帰ってきて部屋に入ったら、目を覚ましてるんです。"
2023061,"00:03:35.0","00:03:40.5","1","目を覚ましてるんだけどー、全然顔の表情が、違うんです。"
2023061,"00:03:41.0","00:03:45.0","1","本当に、えっ、そんな母の顔見たことがないっていうような顔で、"
2023061,"00:03:45.2","00:03:48.1","1","だからその本当にもうせん妄の状態があって、ぐぅっと寝てて、"
2023061,"00:03:48.0","00:03:54.0","1","でー、普通、今目が覚めた、やっと目が覚めたと思ったら、もう本当全然もう別人みたいな感じ。"
2023061,"00:03:54.0","00:03:58.0","1","それもう私、ちょっとそれでゾクッとなって、怖くて、"
2023061,"00:03:58.3","00:04:01.8","1","それでもう、なんか足、体がすくんでっていうか、"
2023061,"00:04:01.8","00:04:05.1","1","動かなくてー、話しかけ、それじーっと見てるわけ、私も。"
