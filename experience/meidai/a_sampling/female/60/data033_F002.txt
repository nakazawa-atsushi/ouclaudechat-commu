Participant F002:
Here are the key personal experiences I extracted for F002 from the conversation:

- F002 moved from Itami City in Hyogo Prefecture to Ota Ward in Tokyo. She lived in Yokohama from ages 6-18 before moving to Tokyo.

- F002's son worked in sales at Tokyo Toyota for 3 years after joining the company, then moved to human resources. Recently he was transferred to a new computer center subsidiary being created.

- F002 was hospitalized for 8 days recently and underwent many tests, but the cause of her symptoms was not determined. 

- F002 has written an advance directive stating she does not want life-prolonging treatment if she has an incurable illness, but does want pain relief even if it shortens her life.

- F002 has registered to donate her corneas after death.

- F002 has a nightly routine of drinking 250ml of beer, taking a sleeping pill, and listening to 15 minutes of CD music to relax before bed.

- F002 moved out of her previous home due to high property taxes.

- F002 used to spend 40-50 minutes each morning raking leaves at her previous home.
