Participant F004:
Here are the key points about F004's personal experiences from the conversation:

- F004 moved to Aichi Prefecture when she was 14 years old.

- When F004 was very young, her parents were strict about things like not allowing snacks or manga. This strictness eased up around high school.

- F004 says she was considered the smartest child in her family.

- F004 recently switched from contact lenses to glasses because her eyes were getting tired. She started wearing glasses about 2 years ago.

- F004 says she gets nervous when she has to talk one-on-one with A-kun for even a few minutes, worrying about keeping the conversation going.

- F004 is meeting with H-chan and others later that day.
