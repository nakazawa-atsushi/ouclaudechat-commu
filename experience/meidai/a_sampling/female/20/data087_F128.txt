Participant F128:
Here are the key personal experiences I extracted for F128:

- She forgot to bring an important paper bag with some items when leaving for her trip. She had to call her sister to try to find it at home.

- She used to go to Gusto restaurant frequently during university, especially after club activities. She would collect points there and eventually got a Game Boy.

- She went to Australia on a school trip in junior high school. Her family frantically made 1000 paper cranes the morning of departure and chased the bus to the airport to deliver them.

- She does Japanese language volunteer work teaching Brazilian residents at a housing complex.

- She lost touch with Japanese pop culture after living in Australia/New Zealand for a year. Now she doesn't recognize many current artists.

- She says her body fat percentage is around 22%, which she considers low for a woman. She compares it to her brother's very low 8%.

- She recommends grilling whole eggplants in charcoal at barbecues and eating them with ginger soy sauce.
