Participant F037:
Here are the key personal experiences I extracted for F037 from the conversation:

- F037 lived in Iwakuni City until age 18, then went to university in Kyoto.

- F037 is originally from Iwakuni City in Yamaguchi Prefecture, but now lives in Nagoya.

- F037 moved to Nagoya from Kyoto, where she had lived for university.

- F037 watches a TV show called "Just" regularly on Mondays and Fridays, and sometimes on Tuesdays. She was surprised it's 2 hours long in Nagoya compared to 1 hour in Kansai.

- F037 did a one-time part-time job handing out flyers at a department store called Maruei. She gets calls for other part-time jobs but hasn't taken them.

- F037 has been living alone for about 4 years now, since starting university. 

- F037 finds it troublesome to keep her apartment clean while living alone. She mentions frequently breaking glasses due to limited space.

- F037's parents seem to expect her to move back home after finishing her studies. They discourage her from buying furniture for her apartment.

- F037 is undecided about whether she wants to move back home or continue living independently after finishing her studies.
