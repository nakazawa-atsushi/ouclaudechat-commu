Participant F004:
Here is a summary of F004's personal experiences mentioned in the conversation:

- F004 is participating in a project to collect 100 hours of conversation recordings. She prefers to get closer to 60 minute recordings rather than just the 30 minute minimum.

- F004 had a close Taiwanese male friend during her first year in France who helped her a lot but also heavily influenced her perspective on France, sometimes negatively. 

- F004 recounted an unpleasant experience where she was invited shopping by the girlfriend of her Taiwanese friend's brother. The girlfriend was very late, changed plans last minute to include her family, and took F004 to stores she didn't like. F004 found it to be a waste of time and distanced herself from that person afterwards.

- F004 expressed understanding of F104's frustrations with a Korean friend who often invites other people along without asking when they make plans together.
