1. F016 has a friend who is a dentist and pays very high insurance premiums, in the range of hundreds of millions of yen.

2. F016 went on a mountain hike recently with the group, returning around 4:30 PM.

3. F016's son lives in a dormitory in Kanazawa, where there is a large wooden sake bottle hanging from the building.

4. F016 used to live in a different area before moving to her current location, and was surprised by the number of birds, especially egrets, in her new area.

6. F016 has experience making decorations and crafts for events like New Year's, including using pine cones and spray paint.
