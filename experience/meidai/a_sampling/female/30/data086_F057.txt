Participant F057:
Here are the key personal experiences I extracted for F057:

- F057 watched "Sleepers" about 4 years ago with coworkers. She saw it at a free screening but felt it left a bad aftertaste.

- F057 is currently reading the 3rd Harry Potter book in English, though she has some difficulty understanding parts of it. She's hoping someone who has read the Japanese version can explain things to her.

- F057's father is 62 years old and his hairline has been receding more each year. Recently at a Buddhist service, he hit his head on a hanging decoration and got a cut because there wasn't enough hair to protect his scalp. 

- F057 liked watching the TV series "Remington Steele" starring Pierce Brosnan when she was in university. When she moved back to Nagoya, she tried to watch it at the usual time but found it had been replaced by a local program.
