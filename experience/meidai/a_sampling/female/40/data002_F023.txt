Participant F023:
Here are the key personal experiences of F023 that I extracted from the conversation:

- F023 traveled to England with F107 recently. They visited places like London, Windermere, Chester and Stonehenge.

- In London, F023 noticed there were many police officers everywhere, including in the Underground, due to heightened security after the 9/11 attacks. 

- F023 and F107 had some amusing experiences trying to exchange money at banks in England, including confusion over what denominations of bills they wanted.

- They visited J's home and met J's family, including her elderly parents. F023 described J's home as very nice with pretty furnishings.

- F023 found it embarrassing when she directly handed coins to a young male bathroom attendant instead of putting them in the designated tray.

- They took a photo booth picture in England, but F023 said the quality was poor compared to Japanese photo booths.

- F023 mentioned she finishes work around 11:30am-12pm on November 4th, when they are planning to meet up for an outing.

This summary captures the key personal experiences shared by F023 in the conversation, without reproducing large sections of text verbatim.
