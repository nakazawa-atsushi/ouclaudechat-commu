Participant M023:
Here are the key personal experiences I extracted for M023 from the conversation:

- M023 recently worked late delivering packages, getting home around 12:30 AM. 
- He felt very tired and overworked, but also had a sense of fulfillment from customers thanking him for working hard.
- M023 had to take a day off work recently because he was feeling very ill, with cold sweats and a fever. 
- He described struggling to stand up during his commute and having to sit on the floor at one point.
- M023 mentioned his job involves delivering beer, and he can normally carry two cases but could barely manage one when sick.
- He talked about sometimes making mistakes with deliveries when he first started the job, but says he rarely makes mistakes now.
- M023 said he enjoys his job more recently, feeling a kind of adrenaline rush from it.
- He described his mother as a poor cook, giving the example of an inedible okonomiyaki she made recently.
- M023 mentioned he writes New Year's cards, unlike some of his friends.
- He is planning a trip to Okinawa in February and was looking at tour packages.
