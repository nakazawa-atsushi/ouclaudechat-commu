Participant M007:
Here are the key personal experiences I extracted for M007 from the conversation:

1. M007 mentions he received a tuition waiver for graduate school and hasn't had to pay tuition fees.

2. He wrote a paper (about 10 pages) in about 2 weeks, and had a junior student (C2-san) help write about 3 pages of the discussion section. This resulted in C2-san becoming the second author on the paper.

3. M007 states he has published with E-san before.

4. He says he could potentially publish about 3 more papers.

5. M007 mentions he gave some advice to C2-san about carefully considering getting too involved in research, as it could impact future career plans.

6. He indicates he's been working on research related to self-correction behavior.

These experiences primarily relate to M007's academic work and publications as a graduate student.
